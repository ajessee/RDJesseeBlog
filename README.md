My grandfather, Ralph 'Don' Jessee, lived most of his life in Lima, Ohio. Late in his life, after his third wife died, his daughter Catherine invited him to live with her in Lafayette, Louisiana. After he moved down there, she enrolled him in a life writing class and much to everyone's surprise, he wrote prolifically. When he died in 2016, he left behind a collection of over 170 stories.
 
I built this web application as a platform to share these stories with his extended family and preserve his writing legacy for posterity. It's also a place to share pictures of his life, and users can signup to share their own personal memories of Don. 
 
The app is written in Rails 6 and currently deployed in production using Heroku.
