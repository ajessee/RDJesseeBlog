6	The use of Dad’s signature is imaginative and somehow connects me with the gentleman.  His handwriting was pretty legible and I always enjoyed reading his hand written letters.  Because of his poor eyesight, he wrote probably all of these stories on a computer with a very large typeset.  So it is nice to ground the work with his signature.	2017-05-17 01:39:45.24078	2017-05-17 01:39:45.24078	2	User	2
7	I must extend a heartfelt thank-you the developer of this wonderful website -  Ralph Donald's grandson, Andre Jessee.  Your design Andre is elegant, ingenious, engaging, and challenging.  You have found a number of intriguing passages in his stories and used them to pull us in and explore with the hope, not far fetched, of finding others just as intriguing.  You are challenging the reader to respond and contribute, whether it be a comment on a story, a photo, a comment on the gentleman himself, or a contribution to one of his favorite organizations (see the last page of his obituary).  Your work Andre on this website is a labor of love and reflects your affection.	2017-05-17 01:53:59.579674	2017-05-17 01:53:59.579674	2	User	2
10	Andre, you have given us a priceless gift with this blog. I agree with David's fine assessment of your creative and elegant work. I look forward to adding some of my favorite photos, as soon as I learn how. 	2017-06-03 21:58:31.707648	2017-06-03 21:58:31.707648	7	User	7
11	Thanks Dad and Catherine! I appreciate the kind words. Building this site has been a labor of love and has gotten me closer to my grandpa by being able to dive into his stories and learn so much about his life that I didn't know before.	2017-06-04 21:45:48.954233	2017-06-04 21:45:48.954233	1	User	1
12	I was concerned about Fred getting lost.  I was pleased that Jake found him.  I would have enjoyed getting an invitation to partake of the rabbit stew, but was that glad that Fred did not have to partake.	2017-06-09 17:43:24.578476	2017-06-09 17:43:24.578476	2	User	2
13	Thanks for this collection; I enjoyed hearing Don tell me one of his stories not very long before he died.  I liked his wit and humor, as well as his keen intelligence.  He was one of a kind, and I will miss him.  Lynne Castle	2017-06-22 00:03:59.15596	2017-06-22 00:03:59.15596	8	User	8
17	I had just finished 10th grade.  Our family vacations took us far and wide.  This is the only one that involved a component of foreign travel - slipping over to the Canadian side of Niagara Falls.  The coast of Maine was fascinating and Dad captures many elements that I still remember engaged my imagination on that trip.  The fog and the horns built to penetrate the fog for the sake of the sailors.  The lighthouses that shined their warnings when the air was clear.   The cold cold water that painfully cramped the arches of our feet.  Impressive waves crashing on the rocky shore. Small fishing towns.  Harvesting blueberries as we hiked Mount Desert.  I don't recall the cranberries.  We were enthralled by the bowls, cups and saucers that remained filled with ocean after the tide receded.  The sea anemones were fun to watch.  I recall that there were other creatures as well, but I can't tell you which.  For the Jessee kids, and their mom, it was a world apart from the flat lands of northwest Ohio where we grew up.\r\n\r\nStephen and I did go scouting for girls as suggested by Dad.  In fact I found one who seemed interested enough to tag along on our venture.  I'll let Stephen speak for himself.  For many years thereafter I was able to call her name.  I believe it was Claudia.  I believe that we may have exchanged a couple of letters.  \r\n\r\nDad mentioned the park ranger's observation that rarely had the sky been so clear.  That fact, combined with the fact that there was very little light pollution in the park, lead to a most remarkable experience that night.   We were overwhelmed by the clarity and infinity of the stars overhead.  At that young age I had never had such a dramatic encounter with our galaxy and the universe.\r\n\r\nOur VW bus always played an outsized role in our vacations.  It didn't disappoint this time with it massive engine failure.  The same thing happened once, perhaps twice, on other vacations.\r\n\r\nIt is a delightful story.  There is a clear reward available in exchange for the effort involved in rummaging through our memories.  Thanks, Dad.	2017-06-26 16:09:21.473762	2017-06-26 16:09:21.473762	2	Story	2
18	I remember trips with Dad and the rest of the family years later, heading south on old US 25 past his office at Westinghouse in Lima, on through Dayton, Cincinnati, Lexington, and on to Middlesboro to see our grandfather. We were in a 1952 Packard and the four kids bounced around on an enormous back seat. Scenic Lexington made a big impression on me with its "rolling pastures with white rail fences and thoroughbred horses beyond," and I remember drawing scenes of horse farms with their white fences when we returned home.\r\n\r\nLexington and the woman in question, Mardelle Jones, left a big impression obviously on Dad. After his first wife died, thoughts of Mardelle drew him back to Lexington, this time speedily on I-75, He made a number of trips during their second courtship and they were much more expeditious than the first time. A faster road may help explain why they got married on the second go round. Or it may have been the dandy clothes he wore the second round, but that is another story.	2017-06-26 16:48:49.827714	2017-06-26 16:48:49.827714	63	Story	2

20	This letter is very touching.  Cancer took Mary from him when she was just 46.  He lived that number of years and more after losing her.  Years of separation can indeed sadly cause memories to fade from mind, especially if we do not actively work on refreshing them and sustaining them.  Life beckons us to stay engaged with the moment, the new interests, the business of day-to-day life.  When are we still and quiet and pensive.  Dad's mother-in-law Bess Werff modeled this approach, but have we ever taken the model seriously?  Dad in writing these stories did some of what Bess did on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nSome of the memories that Dad cites are shared by the family, such as her work with the Girl Scouts and her conversation with the publisher of the Lima News.  Others are enigmatic and refer to situations not shared with his offspring.  "I'm not sure, but I may have really loved you.  At the time I was sure that I was in love with you."  juxtaposed with "Love is not a static thing. It either grows or fades and I am grateful that ours grew stronger."  How are we to interpret this?  I suspect he would have been more clear if he had not been cheated out of living the second  half of his life with her.  Having read this story before Dad died, I don't know why I never asked him about another statement in the letter: "I felt your love for me respecting my decisions. We were able to settle our differences without malice."  I don't have a clear notion of what decisions and differences he was referring to.  Where is Mom when we need her?  She was always willing and able to explain our enigmatic father to us.	2017-08-08 21:07:18.475243	2017-08-08 21:07:18.475243	102	Story	2
23	I wouldn't begrudge the old man his little pet.  It is remarkable that he could see his pet at this stage of his blindness.  I suspect his is exercising a little imagination in his telling of this tale.	2017-09-13 13:26:28.014606	2017-09-13 13:26:28.014606	176	Story	2

7	Halloween	In less sophisticated times, before television, before radio, people entertained themselves and each other by talking. Telling stories was a great way to spend the evening. Halloween was an ideal time to tell stories of ghosts, goblins and witches. Some stories were handed down from parent to child, some circulated among the children and some were made up on the spot. A great uncle could make hair stand up by telling of apparitions he had seen in the woods at night.<br><br>Spirits emerged in ghostly form from graveyards and roamed the countryside, no doubt looking for mischief. Witches left their cauldrons bubbling with brew, mounted their brooms and took to the sky in search of a missing ingredient, such as a boy’s ear. Goblins, who knows where they come from? And don’t forget that bearer of bad luck, the black cat. Such stories were thrilling for some and scary for the slightly superstitious. But there were adventurous unbelievers.<br><br>Mr. Grump lived in a neighborhood of families with children. Children annoyed him by just being there. He was ugly to them, especially boys. One Halloween two or three boys got together and plotted a strategy. They put a quantity of soft squishy stuff into a small paper bag. They made sure the man was home. They found a place in the neighborhood bushes out of his sight. When the time was right they stealthily took the bag to his porch, lit a match to the bag, knocked and rang the doorbell, and scrammed for cover. The man opening the door had no time to identify the boys. He was too busy stomping out the fire atop the squishy stuff, while the boys in the bushes almost gave themselves away laughing. This escapade did nothing to mellow Mr. Grump’s tone, but the boys seemed more tolerant of him.<br><br>A favorite prank of rural boys was to go around turning over their neighbor’s outhouses. A farmer named Frank who had two boys of his own got tired of the annual prank. One moonless Halloween he and his boys picked up their outhouse and moved it back down the path a few feet, exposing the pit. Frank and his family settled in for their usual evening routine. Soon after darkness enveloped the land, voices were heard outside in the direction of the outhouse. It sounded like moaning and a lot of cussing. Frank leaned back in his chair and smiled.<br><br>The result of a most ridiculous prank was seen by some college sophomores on their way to breakfast on All Saints Day. A farm wagon sat atop the freshman men’s dormitory. How did it get there? Obviously with a lot of work. It was probably hoisted there by some fraternity brothers. One may wonder at the stealth employed to escape the notice of C. P. Williams, the college guru of finance.<br><br>Such Halloween celebrations are rare these days, one may conclude. Some “smart” soul came up with the idea of teaching their children to be beggars. Thus was born the game of trick-or-treat. The game is misnamed. If the beggars are invited in and asked to do their tricks they just stand there with mouths agape. They don’t really know any tricks.<br><br>When the beggar era started Mom could just dress Junior from a closet and send him out to a friend’s house to say “boo”. Things have surely gotten out of hand. The world of commerce has taken over. Mom is now asked to buy a costume and a bag of candy for the kid. It even interferes with one’s Christmas shopping.<br><br>Ghost stories, anyone?	1	2017-04-17 23:59:49.183374	2017-04-23 00:12:20.132154	2005	1	\N	\N	\N	624	\N	\N
5	Festival	Like many small towns that have an annual event, a kind of signature celebration to attract visitors, hopefully ones with some money, Pineville has its Mountain Laurel Festival. Residents are encouraged to participate of course. The Festival begins with a street parade featuring high school bands, and floats. Included in the festival is a gala ball, a semiformal dance, held at the school gymnasium. I never attended the ball; I was too young and couldn’t afford a ticket, and I couldn’t dance. I did hang around outside once to listen to the band. The main attraction of the festival is the pageant that takes place at Laurel Cove. I’ll tell you about one particular event at Laurel Cove.&nbsp;<br><br>“Mom, are we going to the festival today?” I asked.<br><br>“No”, she said, “Your daddy has to work, and I don’t feel up to walking that far”.<br><br>“Mind if I go?”<br><br>“No, but be careful, there’s a lot of cars on the road today.”&nbsp;<br><br>Laurel Cove is about two miles from town in Pine Mountain State Park. A gentle brook flows alongside the shaded trail from the parking lot to Laurel Cove. Wild flowers bloom along the trail. Mountain laurel predominates in early May. &nbsp;<br><br>“The laurel is in fine bloom this year” a man said.<br><br>“Yes, better than usual”, came the reply.&nbsp;<br><br>Mountain laurel is a usually small shrub that grows in acid forest soil. It is found along the edges of forest open to clearings, and on rocky knolls. The blossoms are unusual, growing in clusters,&nbsp;<br><br>“Look,” said a lady getting a close look. “They look kind of like tiny Chinese lanterns.”<br><br>“Notice the rich pink color,” said another.<br><br>Upon arriving at the amphitheater people were claiming their seats to wait for the program to begin. First time visitors said words like “Beautiful,” “Magnificent”.<br><br>Eons ago a little stream, storms, wind and snow began eroding a swath down the mountainside, until the amphitheater was formed. It has left on one side of the stream a sheer rock more than a hundred feet high as a backdrop for the theater, and gently sloping ground reaching the forest on the other.&nbsp;<br><br>The CCC boys had busied themselves modifying the nature of the land to create a showplace. Their work provided a stage at the base of the cliff. The stream was dammed to form a narrow reflecting pool in front of the stage. A footbridge spanned the pool at center stage. Mountain laurel outlining the front of the stage was kept low so as to not block the view. Larger plants grew behind the stage. Wherever the layers of rock in the cliff joined, the edges rounded through millennia of erosion, moss and wild flowers grew and laurel clung to the scant soil between. Lichens darkened the face of the rock. At the top of the cliff the usual forest vegetation could be seen. It was a vivid tableau, indeed. Seating was made from large planks supported by boulders at each end. A center aisle gave access to the stage.<br><br>While the crowd was still gathering members of the Transylvania college symphony orchestra began filing in taking their seats on stage.<br><br>“Sure is a fine day,” someone said, “not a cloud in the sky.”<br><br>“Yeah, it’s a nice warm day,” said another, “And feel that cool breeze. It’s perfect. Looks like the ladies got dressed up in their finest spring outfits. Glad it aint too hot for ‘em.”<br><br>Once assembled, the orchestra began playing light classical music. It was a delight to hear. I had never heard live symphonic music before. That’s when I fell in love with the symphony orchestra. Since then I have gone to symphony concerts any time I could.<br><br>It’s hard to remember the program, but there were some speeches and so forth. After a while the music resumed and beautiful young women attractively attired in long dressed filled the stage. I had never seen so many pretty faces at one time. One of these beauties was to be crowned as queen of the Festival.&nbsp; They were all students representing their colleges.<br><br>“Is that the governor down there?” a woman in the audience whispered.<br><br>“Yeah, that’s him, Ruby Lafoon, if you mean the one that’s uglier than a mud fence,” said a man next to her.<br><br>“That’s who I mean. He’s going to crown the queen,” said the woman. “He’s gonna kiss her too.”<br><br>“I’ll bet she keeps her eyes shut,” said the man.<br><br>The ceremony went along as planned for a time. Tall trees around the cove allowed only a small window to the sky. The bit of blue sky that was visible yielded to a little white cloud. The sound of distant thunder didn’t seem to bother anybody.<br><br>“Nothing to worry about, Honey,” said a man reassuring his wife.<br><br>Very soon however, before the ceremonies were finished, the little white cloud was replaced by a huge black one. And the rain followed immediately. It was no gentle shower. It was a downpour. People scurried for cover, but there was no cover save for the forest that soon became very leaky. It was no time before everybody was soaked to the skin. Some of the fleet-of-foot had started racing toward the parking lot, a quarter mile away. Most everyone else realized they couldn’t get any wetter and stayed put for an orderly exit.&nbsp; Then the rain stopped as suddenly as it had started. The sun came out and again it was a beautiful day, but the show was over. Or was it?<br><br>“Oh, just look at my hair!” the woman said in disgust. “It’s hanging down my neck like a wet mop.”<br><br>“Look at my skirt. It has shrunk!” That was heard from a number of women.&nbsp;<br><br>Looking around I could see many others with the same problem. The weather had been perfect for the ladies to don their woolen spring wear. When the wool skirts got wet they began to shrink and the ladies tugged at the skirt to restore its length. But the more they tugged and squirmed, the more their skirts shrank. It was a comical scene. The slips under the skirts didn’t shrink. There they were, the skirts above the knee, the slips below. Finally a woman noticed the other women, and started laughing.&nbsp;<br><br>“You should see yourself. You’re sure a sight,” she said.<br><br>Taking notice of the others, the object of the laughter also began to laugh and said, ”Looks like we all have a new style in our tunics.”&nbsp;<br><br>The laughter became contagious and by the time they reached the parking lot almost everybody was in good humor and having lots of fun. It turned out to be not such a bad day, after all.	1	2017-04-17 23:53:35.620891	2017-04-23 00:12:20.145054	2005	2	\N	\N	\N	1216	\N	\N
9	McLean	Being a local girl, my bride Mary had a circle of friends with whom she had grown up. On the other hand, I was new in town and most of my friends were guys I knew at work. Most of her friends were busy getting married and although we got together with some of them sometimes, we never became close friends with any of them. Co-workers of my age were mainly from somewhere else and prone to get together socially. And so it was that most of our friends came from the ranks of engineers and their wives.<br><br>Mike and Lucille McLean were among the first new friends made in the early years of our marriage. Mike was an engineer at Westinghouse, the same as I. We got together often and became close friends.<br><br>Mike was an easy-going clever fellow who seemed to love his wife very much. Lucille looked much younger than her years. She appeared as a young teen-ager, though in her mid-twenties. The couple wanted very much to have a family, but had not been blessed with a child.<br><br>“We’ve tried all the natural methods available,” said Lucille, “I even take my temperature every morning for a week each month, to see if the time is right. Still I’m not pregnant. We love kids, so we’ll just have to keep trying.”<br><br>“You should quit trying so hard, just enjoy each other,” I advised, but I think my advice fell on deaf ears.<br><br>They may have tried to compensate by being close to other people’s children. At any rate they were more than willing to look after our little boys almost anytime. They took David when Stephen was born. They cared for both boys for Catherine’s birth. On many other occasions they fed and entertained the boys who probably hated to come back home.<br><br>In the early 1950’s the airplane manufacturing business slowed to a creep. Usually when military business slowed, commercial business increased and vise versa, tending to level out the bumps in demand for our electric power equipment. That time however, both slumped together. Mike was laid off. He got a job in Toledo, Ohio and moved there. We continued to visit each other for a while. We even left our boys with them for a week one time. Within a year or so Mike found a better job with McDonnell Aircraft Company in Saint Louis, and moved again.<br><br>We missed seeing Mike and Lucille, and bye and bye we decided to go visit them. It would have been a long drive with four little kids, so we planned to go by rail. The Nickel Plate Railroad had passenger service to St. Louis, but only one train a day.<br><br>It was past the children’s bedtime when we boarded the train, but none of them were ready to sleep. They were too excited to be sleepy. This was to be their first train ride. A porter helped us to get settled into our bedroom.&nbsp; We sat down and contemplated our sleeping arrangements. Each berth was wide enough for two adults provided they slept like spoons. Mary took the upper berth with the two boys at the foot of the bed. I had the lower with the two girls at the foot of my bed. Once we were all tucked in, there was continued chatter among the children for a while. Finally they settled down and all was quiet except for the click-itty-clack on the rails.<br><br>Soon Stephen stirred, then blurted out, ”Brush in bed, Mom!&nbsp; Brush in bed.”<br><br>Mom gave a soft groan, adjusted her nightgown, turned over and went to sleep. I strained to keep from bursting out laughing.<br><br>We managed to finish our breakfast in the dining car in time to get back and pack our things before we arrived. We must have been a sight to behold! There was a young couple, each with two kids in tow, following a porter out of the Pullman car. The porter carried a suitcase in his right hand and one under his right arm. In his left hand he carried Susanna’s little pink potty. I know he was mighty glad to turn over his load to us.<br><br>The McLeans greeted us at the station like long lost buddies. Susanna now carried her own little pink potty like a real grown up two year old as we piled into their car. Passengers were not encumbered by seat belts in those days. We traveled some distance to their suburban home where the children could run and play in the yard and the hugging could start over again.<br><br>We spent the better part of a week with our friends, retracing “old times” and doing things the kids might enjoy. A day at the zoo was lots of fun and reminded us of a striking resemblance of apes to people. Our hosts were still trying for a pregnancy, but to no avail. I reiterated my previous advice to quit making work out of play.<br><br>After our visit we seldom saw the McLeans, but we kept in touch by mail. One evening a few years later I was greeted by Mary with a sparkle in her eye.&nbsp;<br><br>“Guess what!” she said, “We got a letter from Lucille today. She’s pregnant!”&nbsp;<br><br>“Good deal, it’s about time,” said I, “They must have finally taken my advice.”<br><br>That was only the beginning. Every year or two following we heard of a new addition until they had a total of five offspring. At any rate they could now transfer their admiration for other people’s children to love for their own.	1	2017-04-18 00:04:37.477976	2017-04-23 00:12:20.152314	2005	3	\N	\N	\N	983	\N	\N
72	Anger and Disappointment	In talking with Bill Rosenberg, a draftsman at Westinghouse, I mentioned my long trips to see Mardelle and wished she could come to see me sometime. He told me of a certain lake nearby in Indiana, where he went occasionally.<br><br>“My wife and I will be going there for a weekend in a couple of weeks,” Bill said, “why don’t you have her come up and you two go with us for the weekend? We have plenty of room in the cabin.”<br><br>“Sounds like a great idea,” I said, “I’ll write her a letter tonight inviting her.” I got her answer in a week. She agreed. She would come on. I was delighted to hear it. I could spend some time with her without interference by her stepmother who didn’t like me. I guess she had no use for a mountain hick. She had chased me out of her house in my college days.<br><br>The anticipated time came and passed with no word from Mardelle, and likewise no body. With a heavy heart I thanked Bill for the invitation and bade him go on without me. The explanation for the no-show was never made clear to me. I suspect that although Mardelle was over 21, the stepmother had a lot to do with it. I thought that at least Mardelle should have told me that she had changed her mind.<br><br><br><br><br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:27:54.094919	2017-05-01 22:30:52.467786	2008	5	unhappy.jpg	\N	Non-Fiction	245	Middle	Story
6	Growin' up	Growing up during the Great Depression was a unique experience. Many families were hard pressed to make ends meet while others were more affluent. My family was somewhere in the middle. Although Dad’s job as a railway clerk didn’t pay a lot, it was enough to sustain a family. There was enough money to pay the iceman and the electrical bill. It was a great luxury to have light at the flip of a switch rather than to light a kerosene lamp.&nbsp; We even had indoor plumbing. Ah, the advantages of living in town! Mom took a dim view of raising children in town. She had less control of kids’ associates.<br><br>We moved into a house on a good-sized lot at the edge of town, close to a bank of the Cumberland River. There was a vegetable garden beside the house and a barn at the back. Dad must have thought that having a barn demanded a cow. He came home one day with a beautiful Guernsey to occupy the barn. We began to have an ample supply of milk and butter. Mom would make cottage cheese once in a while.<br><br>I got the job of leading the cow up the street each morning to a hillside pasture with other cows. I’d bring her back each evening at milking time. Watching Dad milk the cow made me curious about how it was done. One lesson was all it took to see the technique. Before I woke up to what was happening I had a steady job, which was not my intent. The calf she had after Dad had the cow bred was a pretty little bull. After about two days the calf quit nursing and the cow’s milk never began to flow. The calf was deformed such that he couldn’t eliminate his waste and had to be destroyed. Dad sold the cow. I lost my job, and we all sorely missed the rich creamy milk she had given us. It was the end of our dairy business.<br><br>Frequently a hungry man would stop at the house and ask for food. Sometimes he would offer some work. It didn’t matter to Mom. She would always get a plate of food for him to eat outside. Most of these men were transients on their way to somewhere hoping to find work.<br><br>There were not many toys and the few we had were simple and inexpensive. Rather, we amused ourselves by playing games, mostly outdoors. There was no television, of course, to distract us. There were mostly girls in my neighborhood. Girls’ games were all right when other things were not going on. Sometimes I could find some boys playing football nearby and join them. Our favorite games were cowboys and Indians, and war. Both required guns, which we made ourselves from pieces of wood. The ammunition was rubber bands made from slices of inner tubes. The rubber was attached by a clip at the back of the pistol and stretched over the end of the barrel. Releasing the clip, ordinarily a clothespin, sent the rubber flying, thus the name “rubber gun”.<br><br>We played around the house and yard of one of the boys. There lived next door a woman alone who would frequently come out and raise a great fuss at us. Sometimes she would threaten us but she never asked us to play more quietly. She had a screened-in back porch with a narrow shelf against the screen where she stored small items such as tin cans of stuff. I had made a cannon with a barrel about four feet long complete with wheels. The ammo took about three rubber bands strung together. One day after a chewing out by the neighbor woman, the boys dispersed for a pow-wow. My friend’s garage sat near the corner of the screened porch. This gave us a clear shot at the porch without being seen. If we hit the screen, things sitting against it would fly. With things all set and hidden from view, the cannon was fired and, as planned, things flew off the shelf with a noisy clatter. Out came the woman fussing loudly, but when she could see no one, quieted down and looked befuddled. The boys almost choked keeping laughter quiet. We had won a battle!<br><br>Growing older brought on more adventurous activities. Playing Tarzan along the steep wooded riverbank was a favorite. A grapevine hanging from a tall tree had been cut near its base, making it ideal for crossing over a wet gully. Both my friend Jimmy and I had done it many times. One day Jimmy swung across and I followed, so I thought. Part way through the swing the long malnourished vine broke from the tree. My carefree flight was interrupted and I landed in the muddy gully with the vine following on top of me. I wasn’t hurt but I was mired in mud knee deep.<br><br>Climbing Pine Mountain was a favorite adventure for a young boy. I liked to climb the steep slope to the top with a friend and spend the night there. With some food and a blanket, finding a sheltering rock was easy. A few boughs of fir placed under the rock made dry quarters for the night. Morning would be for exploring the area. From the mountain one could see the whole town of Pineville. I thought it a pretty sight. The view of our town from the mountaintop showed why dad didn’t need the expense of owning a car. It was only a short walk to anywhere we needed to go, whereas, before we moved, he was about six miles from his office. So he had sold his car. Being without a car was not great handicap because we road the train when we left town. Working for the railroad gave Dad the advantage of free rail transportation for the whole family. We made a trip to Florida and other places when he could get a vacation. Most of our trips, however, were back to Grandpa’s house where Mom grew up. More than once Mom was slow getting ready to travel. Dad ran ahead to the depot and convinced the conductor to delay departure until Mom caught up. Out of breath we all boarded the train for Grandpa’s house.<br><br>It was a tough time for trash collectors. Recycling was a home activity. Anything of potential value was stowed away in case it might come in handy later. A set of good clothes was reserved for Sunday and special occasions. Ragged clothes could be used to patch less ragged ones. Shoes were discarded only when the sole could no longer be attached to the upper. Going barefooted was pretty stylish for youngsters when the weather permitted. I could hardly wait in spring to shed my shoes. Appliances were made such that they could be repaired. Baling wire was a handy thing to have around. The thing Dad hated more than not having things he would like was debt, so we simply made do until he could afford to pay.&nbsp;<br><br>Perhaps the greatest lesson learned in the Depression was frugality. Maybe I learned it too well, judging from the amount of junk stowed at my house. But the Depression was far from over.&nbsp;	1	2017-04-17 23:57:56.171186	2017-04-23 00:12:20.159482	2005	1	\N	\N	\N	1244	\N	\N
10	Moving	The stock market had crashed. Many people had lost their jobs. To an employee of the railroad seniority was a very important thing. My dad had been hired by the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad three days after his friend Duffy, and one day before Lawson. Duffy’s job was eliminated, so guess what. Duffy kicked Dad from his job. But Lawson was still around, and the kick moved on from Dad to Lawson. At first jobs were available within a small area, but as the process repeated, available jobs moved closer to the main line of the railroad.<br><br>I had started third grade when the local job market became exhausted and my dad found a job across the mountain in Harlan, Kentucky. Despite my mother’s protests my family decided to move to this job. After all, my dad had had enough of farming rocky hillsides as he was growing up, and other jobs were scarce. But what to do with a third-grade kid was the question. Putting him in a strange new school in the middle of a term seemed most unwise. So my care and feeding were entrusted to my grand parents; and the family left me there.<br><br>Grandpa’s house was a rustic structure made of yellow poplar logs about 15 inches in diameter notched to fit at the corners of the house. The logs were hewn to give the walls a more or less flat look, both inside and out. The main part of the house was about twenty-five to thirty feet square with a full front porch. At the center of one wall of the house was a large log-burning fireplace for heating the room, and sometimes for cooking. Beds occupied three corners of the room, while the fourth corner was reserved for the stair steps to the loft. A dining room and kitchen had been added to the back side of the house. The added rooms were of rough cut lumber. A wood-burning stove served for cooking, and heating the two rooms.<br><br>Grandpa’s house was located on a corner, at a crossroad of the pike and a gravel road. His yard was fenced in for a good reason. Evidently some people in the nearby village owned cows but no pasture. Their cows would wander up the pike, grazing alongside. I can remember Grandpa running out and driving half dozen of the critters back down the road toward East Stone Gap. Behind the fences grew rambling roses, lilacs and apple trees, and in summer a variety of flowers such as columbine and bleeding hearts. There was little room for grass . Across the gravel road by Grandpa’s pasture was a grassy hillside where his horse and two or three cows grazed. On the hilltop was an apple orchard, a great place to hunt morel mushroom in spring. And WOW were they good after Grandma cooked them!<br><br>Grandpa’s barn sat down the gravel road a short distance from his house. Every night one of my uncles would bring the livestock to the barn where the cows were milked. They stayed there until after the morning milking, and then back to the pasture they went.<br><br>Before the depression had set in, two new houses were built across the pike by two of Mama’s cousins. Behind them was bottomland used for growing grass for hay. Farther on was the Southern Railroad track. There were two or three passenger trains locally called shortdogs, and a great number, it seemed, of freight trains hauling coal from the mines.	1	2017-04-18 00:06:29.119636	2017-04-23 00:12:20.166111	2005	1	\N	\N	\N	601	\N	\N
12	Rac-a-Be-Bob	While touring a secondary highway, the children were playing a travel game. They selected an object on the roadside and counted points when the object appeared on a team’s side of the road. The object of the day was a herd of cows. They made no distinction between a herd of milk cows or a herd of beef cattle. When a herd was sighted a team of two would declare a point for the team. The points accumulated for each team, and the advantage would swing from one side to the other from time to time. A side would lose all its points any time a team came upon a graveyard on its side of the road. Thus it was that a large lead could be lost abruptly, causing moans and groans to emanate from the back of the car. The game went on quite peacefully for a relatively long time without much argument.<br><br>“Over on the hillside, a point for us,” a voice exclaimed.<br><br>“Do you see anything unusual about those cattle?” I asked.<br><br>“They’re on a steep hillside.”<br><br>“Yeah,” I said “Anything else?”&nbsp;<br><br>“They’re all headed in the same direction,” someone observed.<br><br>“Did you notice the shape of the hill?” I said.<br><br>“It’s kind of steep,” someone said.<br><br>“It is,” I said, “It’s shaped like a miniature mountain.” The pasture was located on a huge mound, shaped roughly like an elongated sand pile. There was no sand to be seen, however, save that, which may have been around an outcropping of rock that surfaced here and there. The whole hill was covered with thick green grass specked with trees or small groves of trees spaced at intervals providing shade for the cattle. On a bright sunny day such as that, shade would have been a welcome respite from the sun. The mound was set apart from other hills, so that one could walk around the mound without having to go either higher or lower in elevation. That’s what the cows were doing.<br><br>“Those are not ordinary cows,” I said, “They’re Rac-a-Be-Bobs. Their right legs are shorter than their left legs. That makes it easy for them to go around the hill in one direction, but nearly impossible in the reverse.”<br><br>“How did they get that way?” someone asked.<br><br>“Well, a long time ago, some cows got in the habit of just walking around and around, and this habit continued, until after many generations, their right legs became shorter, and their left longer to adapt to their environment. Now, when a new calf is born it has two shorter legs. If the shorter legs are on the wrong side when it is born, it gets lost from its mother and starves to death. In that way the strain is kept pure, and they all move in the same direction. So, what started as a habit many generations ago became a necessity.”<br><br>“Amazing,” came the reply.<br><br>Our journey continued and the game went on. It was many years later before I found out that my story was remembered and may even have been believed by little kids who heard it.	1	2017-04-18 00:10:49.800649	2017-04-23 00:12:20.172784	2005	1	\N	\N	\N	554	\N	\N
13	Serpent	Only a few weeks were left before summer vacation from school. The children were beginning to get restless and yearned for freedom from the constraints of the classroom. It was a warm spring Saturday, ideal for an outing in the park. Perhaps this was just what was needed for a case or two of spring fever. Mary gathered some food into a basket and the family headed out to Fort Amanda Park. Upon arrival our four kids scattered to explore the already familiar park to see what new things they might discover. They scoured parts of the riverbank and some of the scant woods in the park and eventually returned to the picnic area with sharpened appetites.<br><br>After a light lunch we all started on the short walk to the monument that we always visited when at the park. We strolled leisurely, stopping frequently to observing the spring flowers and new green sprigs along the way.<br><br>“Look what I found,” I heard Catherine say as I turned to look at her find.&nbsp;<br><br>“Catherine!” her mother gasped when she saw it draped around her daughter’s neck.<br><br>“It’s just a garter snake,” I said, “It’s harmless.” We all knew that there were no poisonous snakes in our neck of the woods.<br><br>“Let me take it home with me,” pleaded Catherine, “We can make a cage for it. It’ll make a nice pet.”<br><br>After a bit more discussion the two-foot-long snake went home with us. We put together a cage made mostly of screen wire. The snake got reasonable care. It was fed every week. It seemed to like night crawlers and bugs. Sometimes I took the kids fishing at a little pond not too far from home. The fish we caught were tiny. The smallest of these made a nice meal for the snake. It was interesting to watch the snake feed on a little fish. He swallowed the fish head first, his jaws then his body expanding to conform to the shape of the fish.<br><br>One day in August I looked in on the snake and was surprised to see a dozen baby snakes in the cage. This excited my family. We hadn’t even known that the snake was a girl. She was thereafter called Gertie.<br><br>Some ignorance was dispelled the next morning when I counted the babies again. There were only six or eight present. Gertie must have gotten hungry, but that hungry? Imagine, a mother eating her own babies! I rescued the survivors and found Gertie something else to eat.<br><br>One-day, later on someone fed Gertie and didn’t get the cage securely shut. Gertie escaped! Care and feeding of the babies turned out to be more difficult than looking out for only their mother. After a couple of them died it was deemed right to release them to fend for themselves, and so it happened.<br><br>One day in early fall our neighbor, Jean Wright was tending her flower garden next door when I heard an outburst from her direction.<br><br>“Yikes” I heard her scream, “A snake!” It was then that I was sure that Gertie was back in the care of Mother Nature and happier for it, no doubt.	1	2017-04-18 00:12:14.989252	2017-04-23 00:12:20.182655	2005	3	\N	\N	\N	559	\N	\N
11	Training the Boss	Almost everything in the design of control and protection devices had born B.O. Austin’s mark. Be it a voltage regulator, a power or control relay or the overall circuit design, his influence could be seen. B.O. was an innovator. He was always looking for a better way to do things.<br><br>”Jessee,” he said to me one day, “you’ve been working on some of the relays we need for the control circuit for this airplane. Now I want you to put all the pieces together to make a control panel. Here’s the schematic diagram we have worked up.”<br><br>”I recon I can do that. Do we have a charge number for the job?” said I. He gave me the shop order and I went to work.<br><br>I prepared the information needed for the job and sent it to the drafting department. Peck Killian was assigned as layout draftsman. Peck had made the drawings for several of my projects, and we had worked together without any problems. We consulted frequently on his progress and made whatever changes seemed desirable. We didn’t always talk about the job exclusively. One day he told me a story.<br><br>“One night after Gladys and I had gone to bed, she said she heard noises in the house. I listened, and thought that maybe I could scare a burglar away by saying, ‘Hand me the gun, Gladys!’ and she said, ‘Peck, you know we don’t have a gun,’ I don’t know what she heard, but it was no burglar; a good thing.”<br><br>Sometimes B.O. would look in on our progress and make a suggestion which we would discuss and decide what to do.<br><br>The job was nearly complete. I checked in with Peck to see if there was something he needed. He was busy erasing something from his layout.<br><br>“Is something wrong?” I asked.<br><br>“B.O. said that I should move these parts around like this,” Peck said, as he showed me what B.O. wanted.<br><br>“That’s a good idea,” I said, after looking over the ordered change. “I wonder why he didn’t say something to me about it. He assigned me the job, so why is he telling you to make changes? I don’t appreciate it much.”<br><br>“I don’t know,” said Peck.<br><br>“I guess he wants to take over the job. If you have any questions see B.O. Let me know when the drawings are done and I’ll sign ‘em off,” I said, irritated that he had not consulted me. I thought he may as well learn to trust my judgment.<br><br>Thereafter Peck did in fact have more questions which he directed to B.O. I busied myself with my other jobs until Peck’s work was done. I don’t know what conversations went on between Peck and B.O., but they finished the job without me.<br><br>I continued to work on my other jobs as well as new assignments B.O. gave me. He never mentioned my quitting the job he took over, nor did I. From time to time he made suggestions concerning my designs, but never again to people doing work on my projects without informing me. He took his training very well.<br><br>I knew we were on good terms when one day he and I and another guy were waiting for the elevator. It arrived and a well-assembled young woman got off. I took particular notice of her. Maybe I looked lustfully at her, I don’t know.&nbsp; Anyhow, B.O. noticed.<br><br>“Jessee,” he said, “she would paralyze you!”<br><br>I had not the slightest doubt that he could be right.	1	2017-04-18 00:08:58.347786	2017-04-23 00:12:20.191718	2005	4	\N	\N	\N	646	\N	\N
2	Acadia	The family arrived at a campground in Acadia National Park late in the afternoon. Rain was still falling, as it had all day. We carefully unloaded our tents from the Volkswagen minibus, erected them and set up the tent fly over the camp table. The rain slacked to a light drizzle and we were able to unload the rest of our gear and prepare supper without getting excessively wet.<br><br>Here we sat like birds in the wilderness wondering what tomorrow would bring. We had hoped to spend the day exploring Mount Desert Island. That wouldn’t be much fun in this weather. The drizzle stopped but we were soon shrouded in a light fog. From below the sound of foghorns droned in bellowing voices. Our half-grown children were a bit restless and moved about the camp to see what they could see.<br><br>“Where’s David?” Mary asked me.&nbsp;<br><br>“I don’t know,” I said, “He’s probably checking out the girls in another campsite.”<br><br>“I don’t like for him to be wandering around in this fog. He might fall into the ocean or hurt himself on the rocks,” said Mary in the motherly worrying voice.<br><br>“Don’t worry,” I said, “He’ll be OK.” After a reasonable time he did come back with his brother, Stephen.<br><br>“It’s really neat down there with the waves crashing in among the big rocks,” said David.<br><br>“I’m certainly glad you’re back,” said his mother, “Be sure you let us know before you go anywhere else.”<br><br>We had managed to keep our bedding dry while setting up camp in the rain, and so we all slept well and later than usual, despite the frequent bellowing of foghorns. We were all surprised and joyful to see that the fog had dissipated and the sun was shinning through the trees. After a hearty breakfast we consulted the park brochure to get our bearings and started off to explore the island.<br><br>Mount Desert Island is a unique place. Rising several hundred feet above the ocean is a solid granite knoll surrounded by rocky earth, which in turn is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean on one side and a deep fjord on another. The whole area was shaped by the weight of the ancient glacier, which left much of the coastal land submerged.<br><br>We followed a Park Ranger who pointed out interesting features along an easy trail to the top of Mount Desert. Aside from the monolithic aspect, one of the striking features was the presence of cranberry bogs. It didn’t seem right. Everything was downhill from here, so why miniature wetlands? The answer was in the impervious granite; rain collected in cups and saucers formed in the surface of the rock.<br><br>Our attention was soon fixed on the panorama surrounding us. After a day of rain and fog the air was purged of all obstructions to sight. Looking out at the seascape we could see the clear line between two shades of blue that drew a perfect picture of the horizon.<br><br>“Notice all the little islands out there. They’re known as the Porcupine Islands,” our ranger informed us, ”This is the first time all year that they have shown up so clearly, so take a good look.” They did indeed enhance the picture we saw; little nearly-black dots in a sea of clear blue water.<br><br>We spent the next few days exploring the park. Everybody liked the rocky shore where ocean waves crashed in vigorously, making white sprays of salt water, some higher than one’s head. At one point the shoreline is broken by a crevice in the rock, perhaps ten yards long. It seemed to be an extra long sunken bathtub, open at one end to the sea. Each incoming wave built up a wall of water that rushed in, filling the tub in seconds with a furious boom when a wall of water hit the tub’s end. The tub emptied awaiting the next wave. It is no mystery that this is called Thunder Hole.<br><br>Away from the crashing surf, in a small cove hidden away from the main traffic of the park, we found a small white beach and quiet water. It looked so inviting that we all wanted to go for a dip. There were some kids in the water playing around. We all tested the water with our feet. After a dozen steps my feet began to ache. We soon decided that it was a beautiful place, but beware the water.<br><br>To me the most interesting things in the park were the tidal pools around the shore. Erosion in the granite along the shoreline has formed bowls of various sizes. Some are swamped by high tide and remain filled with seawater even when the tide goes out. They are replenished with each high tide. Their water never stagnates. Barnacles attached to the walls of the pools comb the water with tiny tentacles, hoping to snare a morsel of food.<br><br>“Look,” said Catherine “There are flowers growing in the pool.”<br><br>“There’s a whole garden growing in there,” said Susanna.<br><br>“Sea anemones,” said their mother, “They are little animals. Watch how they move around, trying to attract a dinner. They look a lot like flowers called anemones. I wonder which got its name first.” In many shades of pink and white, they made a beautiful flower garden.<br><br>We had spent four days in the park with perfect weather. The day we were to leave Maine for Ohio we rose early to break camp. A moment before we had packed the minibus, guess what, it started to rain.<br><br>We took the New York turnpike on our way home intending to stop and get at least a glimpse of Niagara Falls. We were touring along, making good time when all at once our engine stalled. We pulled off the road and waited. A state trooper stopped to inquire of our trouble, and then made a call on his radio. Before long a flatbed truck stopped ahead of us.<br><br>“Wouldn’t go no farther, huh? Where would you like me to haul you,” the truck driver said.<br><br>“To somebody who can fix this thing,” I said, “The engine’s got a big problem.”&nbsp;<br><br>“Well, everybody get into the van, and I’ll get you there soon.” The driver ordered.<br><br>We loaded up again and watched while the truck bed came toward us and tilted to form a ramp. The driver connected our vehicle to a winch. Soon it was as if we were riding up a steep hill. Then we stopped, but before we could worry about our aspect the truck bed leveled off and left us high above the traffic on the road. Secured to the truck bed, we were hauled down the highway in a unique fashion. The view was marvelous.<br><br>“Wow, this cool!” said Stephen, “I can see everything up here.”<br><br>The truck dropped us at a small garage near Buffalo.<br><br>“Hmm. Looks like your valves are shot. It’s a common problem with these cars. I can grind and reseat the valves, or I can put in a reconditioned engine, which would be a lot quicker,” said the garage man, “I can have you ready to roll early tomorrow.”<br><br>“OK, change it,” said I, ”and point us to a place to sleep tonight.”<br><br>It was a modest place with a kitchenette. Since it was still early in the day, I rented a car and drove to Niagara Falls. We walked across the bridge to get a good view of the falls. I shall not attempt to describe the falls, for volumes of such can be found in any library.<br><br>As promised, our minibus was ready the next morning, and we continued our journey home. We considered our misfortune with the car a bonus. We had been able to see a lot more of the sights around Niagara Falls than we had at first planned.	1	2017-04-17 23:28:54.741245	2017-04-23 00:12:20.201095	2005	3	acadia.JPG	Acadia National Park, Maine	Non-Fiction	1390	Middle	Story
1	A Dip in the Pool	The trip had been longer than we had expected. Sarwar and Catherine had done all the driving. I was just along for the ride to visit my other daughter Susanna and her husband, Dick. We had arrived the previous day and had rested overnight. Yet the little pain in my lower back nagged at me, as it had for the last few days. It was one of those devilish little gremlins that sneak up on a body when it is least expected; one that keeps the victim uncomfortable no matter what position he assumes.<br><br>It was a cool Florida day with its reputed sunshine on full display. I was up at a respectable hour, dressed and ready for the day’s activities. Seeing the sunny day, despite the coolness, I thought it would be pleasant to sit in the sunshine for a few minutes before breakfast. I made my way to the sunny side of the pool just outside the house, and sat in the sun for a while. In the fullness of time I got up to go back into the house. I never noticed that the place where I was walking was raised above the level of the rest of the poolside. The bright sun on the white surface made the difference in elevation nearly imperceptible from my viewpoint. On my way back inside I was oblivious to the four-inch step-down under my feet.<br><br>I pitched forward. Knowing I was falling, I extended my arms to break the fall. Only my right hand struck solid matter. My left hand was over the pool. Resistance to momentum on only my right side caused me to roll toward the edge of the pool. I could see the water rapidly approaching my face as I bounced into the water that felt warm on a cool day.<br><br>My soaked clothes dragged me down as I struggled to find the edge of the pool’s deep end. I managed to right myself and find the edge and pull my head above water and look for the way out. By the time I was halfway out Catherine and Sarwar came running out of the house asking what had happened.<br><br>“It looked like a tsunami of an earthquake had happened,” said Sarwar, ”I heard a splash, then this big wave came rolling to the end of the pool.” Nobody saw me fall in, the place not visible from inside the house.<br><br>“Let us help you out,” said Catherine, but by that time I had found the step out and had sat down on the edge of the pool with my feet still in the water.<br><br>“Why are you soaking your feet with your shoes on” asked Susanna who had just pulled away from fixing breakfast. She joined the others in hilarious laughter at what must have reminded them of a drowned rat.<br><br>“You looked so funny in the pool with your clothes on,” Catherine said, still snickering with the others.<br><br>“I think I broke my shoulder, I said. This may have slowed the laughter, but only slightly.<br>With much difficulty and a lot of help I got out of my wet clothes, which clung to my body as if they were glued in place. It was just as much a chore to get into dry clothes because the pain in the shoulder made my left arm worse than useless. After the struggle I went to breakfast with the gang. The gaiety continued throughout the meal as my companions replayed in their imaginations my dive into the pool, which they had not actually seen.<br><br>After breakfast Sarwar and Catherine went to the trade show as scheduled. Susanna took me to a clinic to see about my injury. The X-rays revealed a fractured humerus. Later when the gang reconvened, the topic of conversation was, of course, the event at the pool. Everyone had his own mental vision of the plight of the victim in the water. Despite my broken humerus the scene was humorous, judging from the chuckles that persisted.<br><br>My dip in the pool was not all bad. I am right handed. I provided entertainment for the whole day and I never noticed my back pain again.	1	2017-04-17 23:18:33.83955	2017-04-23 00:12:20.21317	2005	7	pool.jpg	Florida	Non-Fiction	722	Late	Story
3	College Days	Bud and I were busy scraping old loose paint from the wall of the college dining room and conversing about things not too profound.<br><br>“You boys cut the talk and concentrate on your work,” came a voice from behind me. It was the voice of C. P. Williams, the business manager of Lincoln Memorial University, where we were students. We quieted down long enough for C. P. to exit the room, but I miscalculated.&nbsp;<br><br>“Anybody who can’t do this work and talk at the same time has a one-track mind,” I said in too loud a voice. Bud was motioning me to hush but I hadn’t noticed.<br><br>“Don’t you know who that was?” said Bud.<br><br>“Yeah,” I said.<br><br>“He heard you say that he has a one-track mind,” Bud said.<br><br>C. P. was not the most popular man on campus. In fact he may have been the least. He was a tall, bald, imposing figure whose profile made one think of an eagle, or maybe a buzzard. Anyway it was best not to cross him. It was my sophomore year at LMU and I had been promoted from the farm to the maintenance department with a raise to twenty-five cents an hour applied to my tuition costs. As you may have already guessed, the very next day I got word to report to the farm foreman. He welcomed me back to my twenty cent an hour job.<br><br>The day started early on the farm. As soon as the cows were out of their stalls and milking was done, the stalls were ready for me. Daily layers of fresh straw built up in a few days to be fairly deep, just right for a pitchfork to sink into. The first fork full of the day exposed a divot for the aromatic vapor to waft above the stall floor. Many a fork full later, a farm hand hitched a tractor to the wagon I had loaded and moved out to a field with the “pile it” aboard. I proceeded to pile it here and pile it there; then back for another load.<br><br>Not all our work involved cleaning stables. One day we went out through a pasture to an odd locking structure where we stopped. It appeared to be a building set at the edge of an earthen mound that dropped off sharply under the building to the lower level. The gabled roof on the building extended some ten feet beyond the mound’s edge and seemed to be supported on stilts. It didn’t take long to get to the business at hand. One of the farm hands led a steer up the mound through the entrance to the building. A pistol was aimed at the beast’s brain, and at close range, fired. The animal dropped immediately. Then his jugular vein was cut to expel the blood. The hind legs were secured to a rig and hoisted by block and tackle to an overhead trolley and moved out over the lower level. There the carcass was skinned and made ready for the butchers. The bowels and other waste were left on the ground. The gate to the pasture where the hogs were kept was opened, and the hogs came in for the clean-up. They did a thorough job of it. Meanwhile the beef was hauled off to the butcher shop to be made ready for hungry students.&nbsp;<br><br>Another day I found myself headed for the slaughterhouse again. This time, however, the victim was one of the members of the clean-up crew. The procedure was pretty much the same as before except that the hog was much more pig-headed than the steer had been. After a lot of poking and heading off he was driven to the position for the slaughter. Things went according to plan; his guts were left on the ground and the gate was opened to the hogs. A hog came in and sniffed and turned away as if losing his appetite, then another, then another, unlike a hog. A lot of milling around occurred with the hogs until finally one of them ventured to bite into the leftovers. Others joined him. Eventually they cleaned it up but without enthusiasm. One might conclude that hogs are reluctant cannibals.<br><br>The worst job of my farm experience was working in the hay fields on a hot sunny day. I didn’t mind loading the hay into the wagons, but the thing that made it bad was the chaff that blew back into my face as I unloaded a fork full up onto the wagon. Even that wouldn’t have been so bad on a cool day, but on a hot day when I was soaked with sweat it was miserable. The chaff stuck to the skin and to my sweat soaked clothes. I could hardly wait to get back to the showers. There was no place to scratch because I itched all over. The only good part of a day in the hay was to get away.<br><br>Although my work on the farm was primarily as a “pile it”, it was part-time and best of all, nobody ever saw Mr. Williams snooping around the farm.	1	2017-04-17 23:34:47.550609	2017-04-23 00:12:20.220277	2005	2	\N	\N	\N	892	\N	\N
4	Dad's Folks	Isaac Welch Jessee was the last of thirteen children born to my grandparents, James Abel Jessee and Margaret Bailey. Thus, it will come as no surprise that I tell you that I had many cousins born in the mountains of Virginia. Most of them were a lot older than I, for my dad was 30 years my senior.<br><br>Having grown up on the family farm, Dad joined the National Guard during World War I but never saw combat. He later worked for a hardware store in Knoxville, Tennessee while going to business school. I don’t know what he learned there, but he did well in penmanship. His writing was just about perfect. Still later he went to Appalachia, Va. where his brother, Bill, lived. He got a job as a clerk with the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, sustaining him for the rest of his life.<br><br>Dad met and courted a young schoolteacher, Ivo Wells. They were married and moved into a little house in town where, after an appropriate time, a beautiful child was born. Believe it or not that was Yours Truly. A year or two later we moved to “Bum Holler”, about a six mile move to a house near my maternal grandparents Francis Marian Wells and Octavia Cousins. We lived there until 1930 when we moved to Kentucky.<br><br>In my early life we took occasional trips to Scott County to visit Dad’s folks. I believe that all of Dad’s brothers except Uncle Bill were farmers. I shall try to relate some of my recollections of these people. Note that some of my stories may be composites of different occasions.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;___________________________________&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>Mom got my little sister, Margaret, and me loaded into the car for a trip to Scott County. The car was a Model-T Ford touring car with a folding roof. The day was warm and clear with no need for the mica windows that could be buttoned on in case of rain. Our destination was about 25 miles away, perhaps an hour’s drive. We had toured along for half an hour when we came to road construction along a hillside. A dirt road had been improvised up the hill and around the construction site, serving as a detour. We left the pike and started up the hill. We got half way up the hill where the Model-T stalled. We eased back down for a fresh start. All passengers had to unload and walk up the hill. Dad tried again. This time he made it two thirds of the way up. Fortunately a few of the work crew were available to assist with a push to where the dirt road curved to a moderate slope. At the top we reloaded and went on our way.&nbsp;<br><br>Our trip from then on was pleasant and trouble-free. Soon we came to a farm where Dad’s sister, Becky lived with her daughter, Lettie and family. Lettie was only slightly younger than Dad and had a son and a daughter whose names I can’t remember. While the adults talked of adult things we children amused ourselves outdoors with child’s play.<br><br>About mid-afternoon Lettie’s boy bade me to come with him. We hiked up a hill by cornfields until we came to a place where large-leafed vines covered the ground. It was a watermelon patch, the first I had ever seen. Watermelons in all different stages of development, from blossoms to ripe fruit, were scattered among the leaves. After a thorough perusal of the situation my first cousin once removed picked a medium sized melon. I thought he meant to take it back to the house. But no, he dropped it to the ground.&nbsp; The beautiful fruit broke open and I thought, “What a shame.”&nbsp; I soon learned that there was no reason to fret. A beautiful red interior dotted with black jewels was exposed. My mouth watered and in no time we were taking out chunks of delicious fruit and soon our faces were buried in pieces of melon still in the shell. I had eaten watermelon before, but never like this. People take plugs from a melon to test the ripeness, buy one, take it home and chill it, slice it, and eat it from a plate after sprinkling it with salt to enhance its sweetness. Warmed in the sun to a perfect degree our melon, fresh from the vine, was sweet without enhancement and delicious beyond belief. Never have I tasted watermelon to compare with this. Leaving watermelon rind, stripped of its treasure, two young boys, completely satisfied, returned to their families.<br><br>My family’s trip home was easier than that away. Access to the detour was via a much gentler slope, which the car took in stride. Certainly the highlight of the trip was not the excitement of the detour, though memorable, but my encounter with the watermelon patch.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;_________________________________<br><br>Most of our trips to Scott County included a stop at Uncle Emory’s house. His farm was in a valley at the mouth of a large hollow. The house stood behind a big front yard abutting the highway. An access road to the hollow cut through the farm at one side of the house. The farm was located near Natural Tunnel which was used by the Southern Railway. The railroad track ran behind Uncle Emory’s house along a high ridge. A trestle spanned the hollow near the house.<br><br>The house was a large two story log structure which had been covered with lap siding and painted white, a very attractive place. A few trees graced the front yard. A full-length porch with a swing and some chairs made a homey place to sit and visit.<br><br>Uncle Emory was a tall man like most of his brothers, and well proportioned. His most distinguishing characteristic was, perhaps, his eyes, always bright and pure blue. The blue stood out like a light at night. He was pleasant and seemed glad to see us. His wife, Maggie, was a kind lady with a pleasant smile and quite a bit on the fat side. The daughter, Cousin Willie, was almost a carbon copy of her mother. Roy, the son, was rarely around when we came to call.&nbsp;<br><br>Aunt Maggie would always insist we stay for a meal, or at least a snack. Then she and Willie would head for the kitchen. Any meal was preceded by a trip to the springhouse, located about twenty yards from the kitchen door. I’m no expert on springhouses but this one rated tops in my estimation. It was a wooden structure, built on a concrete base. A channel for water flow was formed into the base and widened into a shallow pool where utinsils sat in the cool water piped in from a mountain spring. Butter and milk from the springhouse completed the meal and we ate with relish.<br><br>Up the hollow a quarter mile or so lived Uncle Pat and family. Of course we would visit them too. Starting up the side road crossing Emory’s farm and into the hollow, the big white house to the left, barns and cattle to the right, high ridges and the railroad trestle as a backdrop made a picturesque entrance to the hollow and Pat’s farm. Up the hollow a way we came to Uncle Pat’s house. No imposing abode, it was nevertheless, a substantial house, fit for raising a family. Pat and Mandy raised six children, Fred, Emmit, Clyde, Phoebe, Pearl and Lovely.<br><br>Upon entering the house we were in a large parlor with a big log-burning fireplace. A low burning fire kept the room comfortable while the older folk chatted to fill in each other on the latest happenings. After a while Aunt Mandy got up and headed out.<br><br>“Time to fix a little supper,” she said, and went off to the kitchen. She come back after a while with an iron pot that she hung on a rod over the fire. Then she sat an iron pot containing corn bread batter into the live coals of the fireplace. Last of all she filled what looked like a big skillet with coals that she scooped up with a small shovel and put the skillet-like pan on top of the container of batter.<br><br>“Well, we can eat after while,” Aunt Mandy said.<br><br>“Come on and I’ll show you around,” Pearl said to me, and off we went to explore the farm. Lovely came too, and showed me how she milked a cow.&nbsp;<br><br>“Did you ever see the star in the cow’s teat?” she asked.<br><br>“No,” I said.<br><br>“Bend down here and I’ll show it to you,” she said, and I bent down to have a look.<br><br>“Closer” said Lovely, “you can’t see it from there.” I obligingly came closer until the teat was only inches from my face.&nbsp;<br><br>“Do you see it?” she said. I got only a glimpse of the “star” when she squeezed and I got an eye full of fresh warm milk. I thought both my cousins would split their sides with laughter over that “gotcha”.<br><br>“Come on, let’s go back to the house. We don’t want to be late for supper,” one of the girls said. I don’t remember what we had for supper but the hot, buttered cornbread was certainly delicious. I don’t know if it was the taste of the bread or my newfound knowledge of how it was baked that made it taste so good.<br><br>On a summer day after the tobacco had been harvested and stored in the drying barn we visited Uncle Pat again. After a short visit Clyde spoke to me.&nbsp;<br><br>“Want to help us grade tobacco?” he said.<br><br>“I don’t know how,” I said.<br><br>“That’s OK, we’ll show you how, Clyde said. I nodded. Then we headed for the drying barn, along with Emmit. The barn seemed to be a loosely constructed building, with considerable space between its vertical boards forming the walls. I learned that the spaces were there to let the air circulate freely through the barn to dry the tobacco.<br><br>Inside the barn stalks of tobacco hung upside down in neat rows, at various levels. A boardwalk along side the tobacco gave easy access to the stalks. We mounted the walk several feet above the floor.&nbsp;<br><br>“Well, here we are, let’s go to work,“ said Emmit, “Watch and you’ll see how it’s done.” He took a stalk and stripped the dried leaves starting with those at the bottom of the stalk. As he progressed toward the top he laid leaves from different sections of the stalk into bins provided for grading the tobacco. Once a bin was full he gathered a number of leaves, as if making a bouquet of violets, then secured the bouquet with a leaf that he wrapped around the stems, making it ready for market.<br><br>“I think I’ve got it,” I said, and went on to demonstrate my skill. With a little more instruction about where the next section should begin I went to work in earnest. As we stripped the leaves and chatted, the thought came to me that I’d seen men chew this stuff. With all this here in my hands, why not try a chew, myself? Maybe I can see why they like it. So, when my cousins weren’t watching I slipped a little piece of a leaf into my mouth. It didn’t taste sweet, as I’d expected. Maybe I’d have to get used to the flavor. As I thought about such things, saliva started to pour into my mouth making my chew soggy, and the flavor stronger. Soon my mouth seemed to be full of liquid soup from a cuspidor and I just had to spit. The spit was followed by the urge to swallow, and I discharged my chew. The room began to sway slightly, ever so slowly. I was glad to have something to hold onto. I tried to not let on to my cousins that anything was wrong and kept on stripping leaves. No one said anything, but I knew that they knew. After a while the nauseous feeling left me and we finally quit the job and went back to the house, my lessons for the day complete.<br><br>&nbsp; *******************<br><br>Dad had stopped at Aunt Becky’s house to invite her to go with our family to visit Grandpa. The road to the homestead was meant for wagon traffic and followed the side of a ridge up a hollow to Grandpa’s house. Dad parked the car and we walked about a quarter mile to the house. It was a large two-story log structure with porches, upstairs and down, on both front and back sides. The porches ran the length of the sides. Each room had access to a porch.&nbsp; All were bedrooms and one doubled as a parlor. Prolific parents need a lot of bedroom space.&nbsp;<br><br>A separate building located about fifteen yards behind the main house served as the kitchen and dining room. It was separated to prevent a kitchen fire spreading to the main house. Eating in that dining room was a unique experience for me. A long table sat in the middle of the room. Wooden benches at each side provided seating for a dozen hungry diners. There were no screens to foil the flies. Instead, a table-length contraption hung from the ceiling over the table. The device consisted of a bar attached at each end to a slat hinged to the ceiling. Strips of newspaper hung from the bar. The thing was rigged to be swayed over the table as a fan. The person at a corner pulled a cord to operate the fly shoo-er. A fly buzzes in to share the meal. Someone pulls the cord a time or two.&nbsp; The fly’s intimidation overwhelms his hunger and he leaves to plot his next attack.<br><br>Perhaps the most intriguing thing on the farm was, to me, the blacksmith shop. I loved to see the fire come to life with the puff of the bellows, watch the steel turn red and become malleable and reform between the blows of the hammer and the anvil. Odd-looking pieces of steel and tools I didn’t recognize hung on the shop walls.<br><br>They raised corn, wheat, other grains, fruit and vegetables on Grandpa’s farm. They had cattle, sheep, hogs, and just about every thing they needed. They sheared the sheep, carded, dyed and spun the wool into thread, then wove it into cloth. Much of their clothing was made from this homespun cloth. The farm was pretty much a self-sustaining operation.&nbsp;<br><br>Grandma Jessee died when I was a baby. Uncle Abe, a bachelor, and Cousin Freeman with his family lived with Grandpa and ran the farm. I recall Grandpa sitting in his platform rocker. He had a full brown beard, neatly cropped, and a full head of hair to match, unusual for a man of eighty. Although someone surely showed me around the place, I can’t remember anything specific about the other people there.<br><br>The walk down to the car seemed a lot easier than the trip up. Even so, I lagged a bit behind the others. By and by I overtook Aunt Becky who stood quite still astraddle a shallow ditch, her long skirt almost touching the ground. I walked on past her and we all soon reached the car and were on our way. I had learned a lot about a farm and thought I had a good idea why ladies of that day wore such<br><br>Long, full skirts.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;******************<br><br>Uncle Billy was a second father to my dad.&nbsp; When Dad was looking for a job he went to Appalachia, Virginia and stayed with Uncle Billy’s family while job hunting, and I’d suspect for some time after, for during that time Dad and Mom courted and married and moved to a little house in town. Uncle Billy, Dad’s second oldest brother, was nearly twenty years his senior. Uncle Billy and Aunt Easter had a family of five, I think, Orlena, Clyde, Mable, Lillian and an older son who’s name I don’t remember.<br><br>Lillian, a teenager at the time, used to amuse herself and me playing with the baby, me. Alas, before I was old enough to remember any of this we moved to the country.&nbsp;<br><br>Fast-forward to things I remember;&nbsp;<br><br>I was no longer a sweet, cuddly, lovable baby, but just a little boy who liked to do little boy things and, Lillian no longer a teenager. My family would drive the six miles to town on a Sunday afternoon to visit Uncle Billy and Aunt Easter. With only adults around, and I, charged to be on my best behavior, I’d sit with them in the parlor and listen for a while.&nbsp; The conversation would soon go beyond my interest or comprehension. I’d sit and notice the kick-knacks and womanly things around the room, and eventually the big pendulum clock on the wall would become my focus. Despite its steady tic-tock its hands seemed to be stationary. I’d look away for a while, but I still heard the tic-tock but ever more slowly. I’d look up to see if the clock had stopped, but the pendulum still swung, but much slower than when we had arrived.&nbsp;<br><br>“Well, we better be gettin’ on back home,” my daddy finally would say, and I’d be first to the door.<br><br>“You all don’t need to hurry off now. Come back soon,” Aunt Easter would say.<br><br>After a few more “Oh, by the ways” we would head for home sweet home.<br><br>Uncle Billy was a carpenter and cabinet maker. After his brother-in-law died he moved to Big Stone Gap to run the Nichols hardware store. I stopped to visit occasionally when I went to see Grandma Wells. I found Uncle Billy and Aunt Easter to be friendly folk and not boring at all. Of course, I was older and could appreciate them as people. On one occasion Lillian, who lived just around the corner, and I were talking when someone called ”Deedee can you come here for a minute?”&nbsp;<br><br>“Excuse me, I’ll be right back,” said Lillian, and so it happened.<br><br>“What’s this Deedee business?” I asked.<br><br>“Honey, you’re the one who named me Deedee,” said Deedee. “You were such a cute little boy, just learning to talk. Everybody thought it was a cute name and started calling me Deedee.”<br><br>“Well, I’ll be durned, Deedee,” I said. Whatever else that happened that day is insignificant.<br><br>When Uncle Billy was in his late nineties he slept in his bed on the second floor of his house. Each morning he came down the stairs for breakfast. Mable, who lived with him at the time tried to convince him to let her make him a bed downstairs, but he wouldn’t have it. He sat in his favorite chair in his living room where he smoked his pipe, usually a corncob, read or snoozed until the afternoon paper arrived. He was a distinguished looking man with few wrinkles and clean-shaven. His most prominent feature was perhaps his five-inch ears, “The better to hear you with, my dear.” His paper was never left on the front porch as were most. Uncle Billy’s paperboy came into the house and handed the paper to him.<br><br>One day , shortly before Uncle Billy’s hunderdth birthday, when the paperboy came in with the paper he was accompanied by his girlfriend. They both sat down, stayed a few minutes, and without saying a word got up and left. Mable noticed this and the next day she asked the paperboy about it.&nbsp;<br><br>“My girlfriend just wanted to know what a hundred year old man looked like” he replied.<br><br>Uncle Billy was evidently the town’s Uncle Billy.	1	2017-04-17 23:51:22.32715	2017-04-23 00:12:20.228003	2005	1	\N	\N	\N	3499	\N	\N
51	Introduction	After our divorce Mardelle had left town for a year or so and had moved back. Dorothy and I had been married for a couple of years. Both women worked for the Humane Society bingo games and were well acquainted. In fact they were good friends. Though divorced, there was no animosity between Mardelle and me.<br><br>One Saturday we decided to have lunch together. We ended up at the Cracker Barrel where one is obliged to browse through the novelty shop between the front door and the restaurant while waiting for a table. When we were escorted to our table the women sat down, but before I could sit a young man at a nearby table stood and said, “Hi Jess.”<br><br>“Hello, Randy. Long time, no see. How’ve you been?” I said.<br><br>We chatted for a few minutes. Randy had worked with me for a short time before he found a better job and moved on. He introduced me to his wife who sat at his table.<br><br>“Glad to meet you. Meet my wives, Dorothy and Mardelle,” I said. I thought I noticed his jaw drop a little with my introduction. Little more was said until Randy and wife finished lunch and left.<br><br>I pondered a moment and said, “Do you suppose I should have elaborated on my introduction of you two?”	1	2017-04-21 22:38:47.768148	2017-04-23 00:12:21.299881	2007	5	\N	\N	\N	233	\N	\N
75	Screech Owl	On a dark night some eighty years ago while sitting on the front porch on a summer night a strange sound rushed out of the nearby woods alerting me to the formerly unknown. I thought it was an eerie sound. It seemed to be a kind of whistling sound that started at a pitch somewhere above the treble clef and bounced down in little steps for about three quarters of an octave in about a second.<br><br>“What was that?” I asked of my uncle who sat there with me.<br><br>“What was what?” he said. Then the sound repeated. “Oh, that. Just a bird.”<br><br>“A bird? But it’s dark. I thought birds went to sleep at dark.”<br><br>“Not that bird, he sleeps in the daytime and travels around at night looking for food.”<br><br>“What kind of food?”<br><br>“Oh, a mouse or maybe a little kitten or some other little critter that stays out too late,” Uncle said.<br><br>“Could he eat me?” I had visions of some huge bird that flew around on Halloween with the legendary witches riding their brooms and goblins that would get me if I didn’t watch out.<br><br>“No, no, he’s not big enough to eat you. He’s not as big as a crow. He’s a screech owl. He gets his name from the sound he makes,” Uncle assured me.<br><br>"Thank goodness,” I said and listened for the next “screech”. I still thought it an eerie sound but unique and interesting.<br><br>Since that night long ago, I have heard many screech owl calls and each has demanded my attention. To this day I stop and listen until he moves on to another spot to continue somewhere out of earshot. Then I hope he will soon return.<br><br>Solitary birds sleeping by day, owls are seldom seen. One could be roosting among the foliage of a tree in your yard undetected, but there’s no doubt about his presence when he calls. What does his call mean? Is it a call to a mate or is it a warning to a potential intruder? I believe it could be either, but I think it is usually a warning to other owls to beware, that he is ready to fight for his territory.<br><br>No matter what it means to the bird, I love to hear it. I’m willing to drop almost anything to go outdoors at the least hint that he is performing and listen to his song. I recently wrote a few words from my imagination of the start of the screech owl’s day because his song gives me a peculiar pleasure.<br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:30:45.659189	2017-04-23 00:12:20.234666	2008	7	\N	\N	\N	464	\N	\N
26	Kidde Men	“R. D., meet Dick Blake and Bill Spaven,” said my boss, “They’re here to show us an idea they have to replace the constant speed drive with electronic circuits.”<br><br>We had been kicking around different ideas for replacing the drive for some time without much success, so any new idea was welcome. The constant speed drive served as the power link between the airplane engine and the electric generator, which is the source of the airplane’s electricity. The drive worked fine but it required frequent overhaul.<br><br>Our guests were with Walter Kidde Company, well known for its fire extinguishing systems. Their presentation derived from familiar radio circuitry, the superhetrodyne. Their presentation was straightforward and seemed feasible, at least for low power apparatus. It was questionable for our use, but it was deemed worth looking into. They agreed to build a demonstration model and see us later.<br><br>Several weeks later the Kidde Company had built a prototype of some kind and were ready to propose the idea to an airplane builder. So I, being the designated local expert on this project, packed my bag and headed for Hoboken, N. J. It is because of two interesting characters that I bother to relate this story. At least I thought they were interesting.<br><br>My welfare and guidance were put into the hands of Bill, who said at the outset, “My name is Spaven, with a long ‘a’. Some have called me ‘spavin’, with a short ‘a’, which I don’t like too much. You see, spavin is a horse disease.”<br><br>Thus, we were off to a good start. We knew what to call each other, but I called him Bill most of the time, which was perfectly fine with him. His routine from the start was to pick me up at my hotel and drive to his workplace where we worked on the proposal. We put together circuit diagrams, illustrations of the workings of the scheme and proposed parts lists. Sometimes assisted by Blake this endeavor went on for two or three days.<br><br>Spaven’s automobile appeared to be about 15 or 20 years old. It ran well, seeming to be well tuned up, but otherwise looking pretty seedy. Each morning Bill drove to the end of the parking lot farthest from the entrance to the building. At first I wondered why. Then it became clear to me. The parking lot sloped upward from the building. Bill selected the spot simply so that the car, having a manual transmission, could coast downhill and not require battery power to start. In fact there was no battery. Once off the lot we drove directly to the nearest filling station. There we took on water, filling the radiator, which gained its emptiness through a small, but persistent leak; this while letting the engine run, of course. On a stop at Bill’s house I learned of his morning procedure. His house was a few feet above street level. He pulled into the driveway and parked just outside his garage. Each morning he first filled the radiator, then coasted back down the driveway to start the engine, then was on his way.<br><br>Talking with Bill, one wouldn’t suspect that he was other than a normal family man. When I met some of his family I was surprised to note that none of the kids resembled him at all. It was a flock in a variety of hues ranging from white to black.<br><br>“How many kids do you have?” I asked, thinking some of the neighborhood kids must be visiting.<br><br>“Seven,” He replied. “They are all adopted.”<br><br>I was in awe of him. He was more courageous than I, by a long shot. I didn’t look in his garage to see if he had a later vintage car than that sitting outside, but if not I’d certainly understand why.<br><br>The preliminary work done, Spaven, Blake and I assembled to complete the proposal. Blake did most of the talking. He was a supervisor and so, inclined more toward sales than toward technology, as are most of his ilk. Our conference room was equipped with a restroom in a corner next to the entrance, a convenience for long sessions.<br><br>After a few minutes of discussion, Blake left the room and returned with Ms. Steno and a portable typewriter. Ms. Steno, a lady a bit more mature than any of us guys, soon proved to be quite adept at using her machine. Having introduced her, Blake, never at a loss for words, began the narrative portion of the proposal. Ms. Steno wrote what he said, never lagging more than two or three words behind the speech. I was amazed, for the words were uttered at a normal conversational rate. Blake described the scheme and its potential advantages in great detail. As he talked on and on he paced around the room without sitting for a moment. After about an hour, when I thought we should take a break, and give Ms. Steno a rest, Blake was still talking with barely a pause. At this point he altered his course and went into the restroom, leaving the door ajar. The talk went on with no interruption. He may have raised his voice slightly to be heard over the telling teeny torrent. Blake soon emerged, still talking, and continued at his normal pace until he finished. He thanked Ms. Steno and excused her. The proposal was virtually complete, needing only assembly and some finishing touches.<br><br>A few weeks later this same team met with a group of engineers at the Boeing Company in Seattle, Washington to present the proposal. Dick Blake was, of course, our spokesman. He spoke smoothly and confidently. When finished, he took questions from the Boeing engineers. It all went well until the last question was asked. Blake was obviously stumped and paused for a moment to relax.<br><br>“Gentlemen,” he said, and after another pause continued, “that will yield to design.”<br><br>“Ouch, I never thought of that problem, either,” I said to myself, “It may take more effort than anyone is willing to support.”&nbsp;<br><br>For quite some time after that, the Kidde Company continued to work on the scheme, which might have “yielded to design” if electronic parts developed years later had been available at the time. We at Westinghouse, after much diligence for several years, produced the desired product but through use of a different method. Nevertheless, I am glad to have met these two unforgettable characters.	1	2017-04-21 00:26:33.516264	2017-04-23 00:12:20.241648	2005	3	\N	\N	\N	1116	\N	\N
21	Canoe	The Boy Scouts of Troop 30 were assembled at the canoe livery, ready to journey down the river. For some of the dozen boys this was their first experience with a canoe. Scoutmaster, George Anderson, gave the boys some instructions before they set off in their canoes.&nbsp;<br><br>“Two guys to a canoe, select a buddy and stay with him. Stow your camp gear and food in the middle of the boat. Be sure to cover it to keep it dry. I have selected a nice campsite on the map. Stick together and we’ll meet there and make camp for the night,”<br><br>The boys loaded their canoes and were given safety instructions. Then they set off down river.<br><br>It was not technically a wild river but it was close enough for the boys. The river traversed through a completely wooded area. The only sights of human involvement were broken twigs, overturned rocks and the leftover tracks of campers. The water was clear and cold, running moderately fast. Stretches of the river ran straight and quietly for a short way. Then just around the bend ahead, a rapids appeared, shallow water flowing over a bed of rocks, with boulders of various sizes placed promiscuously so that there was no straight pathway between them. This, of course, presented a serious obstacle for the canoers, especially the new ones. Further, it explained most of the dents and scratches in the aluminum canoes. There were many rapids in the course of the river, each affording its own challenge.&nbsp;<br><br>There was scarcely a sluggish spot in the stream. Even where the water seemed to run quietly, eddies played along the shore and little whirlpools danced about and hid among the leaves of a small shrub that bowed to the river. Riding with the current, one would frequently encounter a young tree that took root on the shoreline, grew for several years, and then succumbed to the forces of nature. It lay there still green, helpless in the passing water.&nbsp;<br><br>On the first leg of their trip the boys learned, more or less, to control their canoes, and work as pairs. A couple of teams evidently got carried away and pulled ahead of the troop and didn’t recognize the planned campsite. Scoutmaster Anderson was more than perturbed when he found the campsite vacant.<br><br>“Damn it, I told them to stay close together. I ought to just let ’em fend for themselves until we catch up with ’em tomorrow,” said George. Then he thought about his responsibility, and continued “We’d better go on and catch up.”<br><br>About an hour and a half later the others overtook the eager beavers at an inferior camping place. Darkness was near, and when George was done chewing out the culprits it was much nearer. They made camp and had supper by flashlight, firelight or in the dark.<br><br>After breakfast the boys broke camp and loaded their canoes.<br><br>“Today we have only a short way to go, so take your time. Enjoy the scenery. Stop now and then. Nobody is to be out of sight or hearing of the group,” George laid down the law.<br><br>It was a leisurely day. Hardly anyone went faster than the current. They needed only to steer the canoe. Although there were some wet feet, they all managed the rapids without swamping a single canoe.<br><br>The boys pitched their tents at the new site in a relaxed manner and prepared for a good time that night, with even a campfire.<br><br>The next day went as one would expect. There was an occasional flurry of getting a canoe untangled from brush or getting around a huge rock in a rapid.<br><br>Some heard these words ahead and just around a bend in the river, “Look! Up there! It’s an eagle. Watch him soar.” Then, a moment later,<br><br>“Left, Gordon. Left, Gordon! LEFT, Gordon!!!” Next, scrapping, scratching, and moaning sounds were heard, then, “I meant right, Gordon.”<br><br>The expected sight was a reality. The river’s current was driving them ever deeper into the tangle of a fallen tree. With help, the embarrassed pair finally escaped.<br><br>Weather for the trip had been perfect. At their campsite the sky was clear and bright.<br><br>“Let’s sleep under the stars tonight,” one boy said.<br><br>“Good deal,” said another. “ It’ll save a lot of work, putting up tents.”<br><br>George Anderson consented, but warned, “Be prepared in case it rains.”<br><br>It was a star-studded night when the boys turned in. Some enjoyed lying on their backs searching out constellations before they went to sleep. Most of them slept well for a while.<br><br>“Ouch, my face is wet. Oh, it’s raining. It’s not suppose to do that,” came a cry from the dark. There was instant bedlam as the “starlight” sleepers awoke and looked for tents. Some took refuge under the overturned canoes. By the time the tents were ready most things were wet, or at least partly so. They nevertheless survived the night, and were up at daybreak. The rain had stopped and they were greeted by another bright sunny day. They packed their soggy gear into the canoes and after a somewhat gloomy breakfast headed down the river on the last leg of their journey. The river flowed into a manmade lake. As they approached the lake, moving the canoes forward became more work and slower. The troop paddled along until they came to a clear grassy area where they went ashore. They unloaded the wet stuff from the canoes. It was not long before the place looked like the proverbial Chinese laundry. Every shrub in sight was covered with wet clothes, sleeping bags and such. By the time their drivers returned from the canoe livery, the stuff was dry enough to pack for the trip home.&nbsp;<br><br>“We’ll get everything right next time,” they all agreed, not realizing all the hazards they had avoided.	1	2017-04-18 00:43:09.225467	2017-04-23 00:12:20.248707	2005	2	\N	\N	\N	1036	\N	\N
25	Flossie	“You sound high-schoolish. Please remember what I just told you. Now, let’s try it again,” Miss Minter said.<br><br>“That’s an odd thing to say to a bunch of high school kids,” I thought “What could she expect us to sound like?”&nbsp;<br><br>She was dead serious. She would never be satisfied with anything less than perfect. We tried it again, and again, and again.<br><br>Flossie Minter, an attractive, young redhead with penetrating brown eyes, was the new music teacher at Pineville High School. This was her first job and she wanted to be successful. There would be vocal music contests in the spring, featuring mixed chorus, boys’ chorus, girls’ chorus, quartets, solos, and so on. Naturally, Miss Minter wanted to make the best showing possible. If we should do well in the regional contests we would be invited to the state contests at the University of Kentucky. To that end we had rehearsals not only during the regular class periods, but also frequently after school. In a weak moment I had let Flossie talk me into singing a bass solo. I felt most inadequate to take on such a challenge, but I was stuck with it. The rehearsals continued, honing the “high-schoolish” edges from our renditions of the music.<br><br>I had signed up for Glee Club because I thought it would be a fun thing to do. I could get out of a study hall once or twice a week, and sing fun songs with the group. Besides, there were attractive girls in the club, perhaps one in particular. Things worked my way for a while, then Miss Minter got serious about it and we began trying contest-type songs. My plans had been foiled. One day Flossie announced that on a Saturday night not too distant the Glee Club would put on a recital for parents and other local folks, no doubt a warm-up for things to come.<br><br>A week or so before this not too distant Saturday, Amster Howard, scoutmaster of Troop 15 of which I was a member, announced a weekend campout for the troop.&nbsp;<br><br>“I can’t go,” I protested. ”Flossie Minter has a recital scheduled and I have to sing a solo.”<br><br>“Don’t worry, we’ll get you back in time for it,” Amster said.<br><br>“Boy, I hope so. She can be cruel,” I said, but decided to take the chance. We had a good campout Friday night and Saturday morning. Several of the boys worked on, and passed advancement requirements. In the afternoon I began to get a little nervous. Just the thought of singing made me so. I knew I didn’t have a solo voice. So why did I agree to this? After an early supper we headed back.<br><br>We arrived on time, but not at the schoolhouse. I’d not dare face Flossie in camp clothes. At home I realized that I needed a bath, but no time for that. I changed my clothes as fast as I could and headed for the school in a trot.&nbsp;<br><br>“Sorry I’m late, Miss Minter,” I managed to say between gasps for breath.&nbsp;<br><br>She muttered some unintelligible words that I wouldn’t tell even if I could remember. According to her agenda my turn had passed, so I thought she would give me time to get my breath before I went on.&nbsp;<br><br>“Go on out there,” Flossie said as soon as the applause for the previous performance ceased.<br><br>“Now? As long as my turn has already passed can’t we wait for the next turn?” I pleaded.<br><br>“Now,” she demanded.<br><br>I walked slowly toward center stage, vying for a few seconds delay. I felt sweat running down my forehead and reached for my handkerchief. I could hear Flossie sigh as I wiped my face. My knees trembled. Had I not been bow-legged they would have beaten each other black and blue. Somehow I managed to get through the song and retire from the stage. Flossie said something to me as I returned but I had no interest in what she said. I was spent. More important, I was done.<br><br>Mercifully, I don’t remember whether or not I had to sing the solo in the regional contests. All of the group events scored well. We went on to the state contests at Lexington. Nearly all our group events got a superior rating. No rating was less than excellent. I think Miss Minter was pleased with us.<br><br>EPILOGUE: Wouldn’t you know it? This poor dumb bunny agreed to sing a solo the very next year.	1	2017-04-21 00:23:53.0325	2017-04-23 00:12:20.255591	2005	2	\N	\N	\N	802	\N	\N
24	Christmas in April	Christmas 2004, I opened a scroll of paper having a fancy border and bearing the following words:<br><br><blockquote>Santa really did come<br>And he brought you a gift.<br>No lumps of coal,<br>But something that’s fit<br>For the king that you are<br>In the eyes of your girls.<br><br>You’ll get on the plane<br>With Catherine in tow<br>And land in New York<br>(We hope with no snow).<br>A concert at Carnegie Hall is in store<br>For the man who loves music,<br>The man we adore!<br><br>At the airport you’ll hook up<br>With Susanna (I hope)<br>And for 3 days and 2 nights<br>We won’t let you mope!<br>We’ll explore and have fun<br>Seeing old sights and new<br>We’re excited and hope<br>That you will be too.<br><br>Prob’ly sometime in April<br>This journey will start.&nbsp;<br>Who knows?<br>We may even hear Mozart!<br>We’ll give you the details<br>Once they’ve been made.<br>Just know that your flight,<br>Room, and ticket are paid!<br><br>New York….here we come!</blockquote><br><br>‘Twas the night before Christmas-in-April began that we sat in the rec. room, a movie to scan. We had just settled down to enjoy the show when the telephone rang, now wouldn’t you know. An airline gal said, “Your trip has been changed. Storms ‘round Atlanta have your schedule deranged.”&nbsp;<br><br>And so it began. Our connecting flight had been cancelled, and to arrive at New York at a proper time, we would have to leave before 6:00 am instead of late morning. We gave up the movie, finished packing our duds and went to bed for short naps. Catherine drove us to the airport where we got into the “hurry up and wait” line. We boarded the airplane on schedule. Had our revised schedule held, we’d have had time for a good afternoon nap after we arrived. But no such luck. After sitting in the plane for half an hour we were advised to return to the terminal and wait for further instructions. While we waited, Susanna likewise waited in Tampa. Having left about two hours late we all arrived in Atlanta only to find that our connecting flight had been cancelled. I supposed that we would end up heading back home rather than onward. Following a couple of long walks through the airport we were advised of another flight from a different concourse where we might get on standby. After another longer walk we made it to the flight area and got on the standby list. My hope of going on had not risen, but after a good while the plane was boarded and we were admitted aboard. We arrived in Newark a few minutes ahead of our original schedule, before the phone call, that is. A taxi ride of a little more than half an hour landed us at our hotel.<br><br>Our trip back home was no less frustrating. We awoke to a rainy day, a day we had hoped to use for seeing some of the sights. I could see from my window that the top floors of the Empire State Building were shrouded in the clouds. I had noticed a peculiar hazard of walking the streets, the risk of getting stabbed in the eye by the rib of an umbrella. Anyway, we were all tired and decided to hang around the hotel and entertain ourselves as long as they would have us.&nbsp;<br><br>A taxi got us to Laguardia airport two hours before our flight time. At boarding time our airplane was flying in circles, waiting for permission to land. It landed an hour late at Newark airport. After a while we were told that two airplanes were flying around in the clouds and the first of these to arrive would be dispatched as our transportation. So far as I know they may be still flying in circles. Eventually an airplane was made available for a flight to Atlanta. It was a Boeing 757. Leaving Susanna in the terminal, Catherine and I made the long trek to its gate and boarded while the plane rocked and bucked in the wind. Once seated, it looked as if we had walked a block since entering the plane. Two flights must have been combined to require a 757.&nbsp;<br><br>The flight to Atlanta was uneventful, but of course, much too late. We had to spend the night at a hotel and wait for the morning flight home. We were glad to get word that Susanna’s flight to Tampa had delivered her in time for her to sleep in her own bed. My story up to this point confirms a favorite old saying, “When you have time to spare, go by air”.<br><br>There are a few things that I should mention perhaps, before I close this saga. What happened between travel obstacles? The day between our coming and going was a gray day without rain, not very good for viewing scenery . We decided to experience the subway and go to the botanical gardens. We found the place and discovered that spring had just arrived. Crocus and daffodils were in bloom and buds swelled on some of the bare branches. We could only imagine how it would look a month hence. We turned our attention to the conservatory. Many exotic plants thrived there. The most interesting to me were the bonzi trees. A wide variety was to be seen, some forty years old and only a foot tall. See what starvation can do?<br><br>We got back from or outing in time to eat a bite and despite Susanna’s<br><br>broken rib, walk about three of those long blocks to a theater where “Chicago, the Musical” was playing. I though it was a dumpy place, having enough room for the audience to sit, but barely more. Restrooms were located upstairs on the balcony level and hard to track down. At intermission the lines extended from the foot of the stairs to the balcony. I was, indeed, glad there was no fire alarm heard. The show was entertaining. It was a song and dance routine, having a flimsy plot with “special effects” along the way. The dancing was excellent.<br><br>Our main reason for the trip was well rewarded. Carnegie Hall didn’t look so impressive on the outside, but inside it was a different story. The hall was evidently patterned after European opera houses, with semicircles of box seats over the back of the main floor. We entered through the opulent lobby and up a flight of stairs to a long curving hallway with many doors on one side. Pictures of many world famous musicians who performed there hung on the wall where there was no door. We entered by a door designated by our tickets, walked through a small cloakroom, through a second doorway and into our box. I was flabbergasted to be among the best seats in the house. How do I know that? The lady present when we arrived told us so. She was evidently a regular patron of that box, and had many good words to prove her point. I have no reason to doubt her. From our vantage point nearly all of Isaac Stern Auditorium, from the stage to the five rows of box seats, was visible. The color was a pleasing cream pastel. The hall alone is merely a pretty landmark. When a fine orchestra is playing, it becomes an instrument of pure pleasure. The pleasure was enhanced for me by the sublime music of Mozart. Being just the right size for the music, the Orchestra of St. Luke’s played “Piano Concerto No. 25” and “Symphony No. 38” plus short pieces by two other composers. I can’t imagine that it could have been better.&nbsp;<br><br>Considering the barriers set up by the weather, and the fact that I was worn down from a cold, was the trip worth while? I would certainly vote “yes”. My daughters were extravagantly thoughtful of their old dad, and we all had a merry Christmas in April.<br><br>NOTE: Conductor, Donald Runnicles; Piano, Ivan Moravec.	1	2017-04-18 23:29:18.16481	2017-04-23 00:12:20.262664	2005	8	\N	\N	\N	1412	\N	\N
19	Army	After six months on the Westinghouse student course in Pittsburgh, I made my way to Lima, Ohio for my next assignment. With help, I got settled into living quarters and reported for work. My assignment was simple, assisting an engineer in the design of relays for use in airplanes. I was soon encouraged to get off the student course and become a regular employee. Before I became acquainted with my fellow workers I received the customary “Greetings” letter from my draft board. So much for my foray into the world of industry, where I had hoped to contribute some small thing toward winning World War II which still had a year and a half to last.&nbsp;<br><br>I reported to the induction center at Fort Thomas, Kentucky. From there, a long train ride landed me with a group of recruits at Camp Crowder, Missouri for basic training.&nbsp;<br><br>I don’t remember many of the details of my four-month stay there. Perhaps I meant to forget. I remember reveille, morning roll call, barracks inspections, KP duty, close order drills, Sunday night cold cuts, calisthenics, the obstacle course, and the sergeant who delighted in leading the company on midnight-till-dawn hikes, where I learned the trail rocks by their first names. I enjoyed the days on the rifle range. When someone missed the target completely, the bright red Maggie’s drawers would be run up the pole behind the target. I never earned that “honor”. Inasmuch as I was in Signal Corps basic training I was required to attend classes in basic drafting. Drawing electrical circuit symbols was a boring task, especially on a hot day that would cause sweat to drip from my nose on to my paper. The thing I hated most was certainly not boring. Crawling on my belly across a field with bullets flying over my head was far more exciting than I desired.&nbsp;<br><br>Perhaps the most enjoyable day of my stay at Camp Crowder was one on which a buddy and I escaped to take a train ride to Eureka Springs, Arkansas. My buddy talked the train engineer into letting us ride in the cab of his steam locomotive. It was a new experience for me. Of course we had to stand clear of the operators, but there was plenty of room. It was interesting to see the view of tracks ahead, and to blow the whistle. The fireman watched the steam pressure gage and shoveled in coal accordingly. All this reminded me of my boyhood dream of driving my own train. The only thing wrong with the ride was that it was too short. We spent the afternoon wandering around the resort, and took the next train back, arriving in time for Sunday night cold cuts.<br><br>I learned at least one useful thing in basic training. I learned to drive an army truck. This was my first driving experience. I figured that if one could drive a truck that had to be double clutched, one shouldn’t have any trouble driving anything else.<br><br>After completing basic training a group of us were shipped to Fort Monmouth, New Jersey for Signal Corps training. I had been there only a short time when I was granted a furlough. I used the time off to visit friends and family and returned by train. As the train approached my destination I noticed it was raining. I got off the train and boarded an army bus waiting at the train station. As the bus moved toward the base I realized that it was a really nasty night. The rain fell harder and harder and the wind seemed to pick up speed. After an uneasy ride the bus stopped at the PX (post exchange) to discharge its passengers. I made a dash for the door through the driving rain. Once inside I remembered that somewhere along the east coast a hurricane was lurking, but I never dreamed that I would meet it head on.<br><br>I hung around the PX awhile along with the others, dreading to venture out into the storm. The barracks was about two hundred yards away. I finally bucked up my courage and dug out a slicker from my duffel bag. I opined that if I rolled up my pants as far as possible that I might save them from being soaked. So I rolled them up, put on the slicker with my bag tucked underneath, and faced the storm. I leaned into the furious wind and as if I had been pulling a heavy sled made my way to the corner of the street. At the corner things became much more difficult. I needed to turn the corner to get to the barracks. This was not a straightforward maneuver. I had to reorient my brain once I started to turn. I staggered around awhile before I could resume walking, for now I had to lean far to my right instead of forward. I was lucky not to have been blown off my feet. Once I regained my balance I continued the long walk to the barracks leaning sideways into the wind. I had to make one more turn before I arrived but that was less hard to do, having practiced the turn.<br><br>Did rolling up my pants help keep them dry? Not in the least! Despite the slicker and my best efforts, my only dry clothing were my under shorts. I hung up my soaked stuff and went to bed, but sleep didn’t come easily. The roaring wind and rain caused visions of a flying roof, our roof. The sound of the storm seemed to increase as the night wore on. Despite the constant disturbance I did finally sleep, only to be abruptly awakened by the Budweiser Clydesdales galloping across the roof, dragging their beer wagon. I feared that the roof had followed them and waited to be soaked again. Being still dry, I slept fitfully until morning. By then the storm had passed. I got up, and with my fellow privates went out to view the damage. Each barracks had a large steel-pipe chimney at one end, supported by guy wires attached to a ring at roof-level. Our chimney was shorter than others. It obviously had broken off at the guy wire ring and disappeared.&nbsp;<br><br>“So,“ said I, “I was mistaken about hearing horses last night. It must have been our chimney making its escape.” No word was ever heard of the whereabouts of our chimney.&nbsp;<br><br>In the weeks that followed I went to training classes to learn about Signal Corps stuff. I had almost learned the Morse code when one day I found myself undergoing a physical examination. A doctor looked at the protrusion just below my Adams apple, asked a few questions and took some notes. I’d had a lump on my throat for two or three years, now about the size of a small hen egg. A day or so later I was ordered to report to the hospital. There I underwent surgery to remove the lump, a benign tumor attached to my thyroid gland. It would be forty years before I learned that the surgeon took half of my thyroid gland with the lump. Of course I fell in love with my nurse, a pretty red headed young woman. The affair lasted until she made me get out of bed and walk around.<br><br>Walk around I did until the incision in my throat healed. The doctors agreed that the scar left looked all right. Soon orders were handed me to report to Fort Sheridan, Illinois for mustering out ‘at the convenience of the government”. At that point it was also at my convenience, for I had felt misplaced. I wanted to apply my meager skills to an endeavor that mattered. In a few days I was given my discharge papers, mustering out pay and a few clothes, then bid good bye. I said good bye to my military career, but not before I had experienced the frosty feeling of standing on the shore of Lake Michigan in a January wind.<br><br>A civilian once again, I traveled home to see my parents before returning to Lima. In about a week I went back to Westinghouse and admitted that the Army didn’t want me after all. My new boss said they wanted me back. I was glad to be wanted and stayed for fifty years.	1	2017-04-18 00:38:47.897911	2017-05-01 22:40:37.875873	2005	2	army.jpeg	Camp Crowder, Missouri	\N	1428	\N	\N
17	Write? Me?	Like many a widower I tried to continue my normal activities in the community. I maintained my interest in the arts, in church and personal relationships as best I could. Though lonely for my mate, I was beginning to cope with a lifestyle alone in a house big enough for a family. I lived pretty much an independent lifestyle.<br><br>About a year after my wife’s death I began to notice that it was harder to read the newspaper. I needed brighter light to see things clearly. I passed the eye exam for a driver’s permit, but it seemed much harder than before. I soon realized that I had the symptoms of macular degeneration, which meant that my sight would get only worse. Another change in lifestyle was inevitable. At first I could see well enough to do the regular household chores and even drive to my appointed rounds. As time went on I could not be sure of what I saw. This could be hazardous to not only myself, but to others.<br><br>My children had long ago moved far away. They all agreed that I should move out of my house for other accommodations. Should I seek a local abode or live with one of them was a question we discussed in detail. It would be hard to leave friends and neighbors after so many years. After thorough consideration I decided to move in with my daughter, Catherine and family. There I could have a private area and stay pretty much out of their way, and yet be close to some of my family. Thus it is that I live in Lafayette.&nbsp;<br><br>What does one with restricted abilities do in a new environment? Catherine set out to answer the question. The best thing she came up with was the Life Writing class. At first I was reluctant to sign up for such a class. It sounded like work. I am the world’s worst letter writer, or close to it. I had written technical reports in my job as an engineer, but nothing more. She talked me into joining the class, citing stories she had heard me tell.<br><br>I felt out of place at the first class that I attended. Why was I there? Simply at the urging of my daughter. By the end of the session I felt more comfortable, at least willing to try my hand at writing a story. It was painful to write about things, which had been embarrassing to me at the time they happened. But when I read what I had written, I realized it wasn’t about me, but about a little boy who lived a long time ago. Upon hearing my classmates read their stories I realized that their lives might not have been so different from mine. That gave me confidence to write my own stories.<br><br>Participating in the class has benefits other than just teaching me to express my thoughts and feelings through narrative, dialogue and making a dull story interesting. Needing to write stories for class has given me an incentive to write that I would otherwise not have.&nbsp; Writing gives me a sense of accomplishment. Kim, our instructor, has been very supportive of all in her class by encouraging us to write in our own styles.<br><br>Going to class gives me a good reason to get out of the house into different surroundings. It provides a fellowship with others that is valuable to all of us. We all get acquainted with others in a way that could not happen in any other way.<br><br>I have gained far more than I though possible. Thanks to the class, I have a gift to give to my children that I can’t buy for them at a shopping mall.<br><br><br><br><br><br>	1	2017-04-18 00:32:01.830281	2017-04-23 00:12:20.269492	2005	8	\N	\N	\N	652	\N	\N
29	Mitchell	“Now that we’re in South Dakota we ought to stop in Mitchell and see the Corn Palace,” I said as we drove along in our Volkswagen minibus en route home from a month’s tour of the western parks of the USA. The minibus was loaded with camp gear that left just enough room for four children big enough to do most of the camp work, and their mother.<br><br>“Sounds good to me,” said Mary, the mother, “I’ve heard of it.”<br><br>The Corn Palace is a building big enough to be a theater. Each year a crew constructs a mural on the side of the building made entirely of corn ears. Corn comes in such a wide variety of colors that the artist has little restriction in his palate. We parked nearby to gaze at the picture on the wall. It depicted a farmer at work harvesting grain in a vast field with hills in the background. We were amazed at the detail included in the picture. We looked at it for a long time, it seemed.<br><br>Right behind us, while viewing the scene, I noticed a Volkswagen dealership. I was glad to go in and buy a key for my gas tank door. I frequently lost one to a service station attendant who forgot to return it after putting in gas.&nbsp;<br><br>We found a grocery store, replenished our larder and moved on. About ten miles down the road the engine began to labor so that our top speed was about forty miles per hour. There was nothing to do but to turn around and head back to town. Luckily, I knew where the Volkswagen dealer hung out.<br><br>“We’ll have to put in new valves and valve seats,” said the garage man (where had I heard that before?), “We can have it ready for you at about eleven o’clock tomorrow.”&nbsp;<br><br>“Great,” I said, “But where do we stay in the meantime?”<br><br>“There’s a nice little park where you can camp just out of town. We’ll take out the engine and tow you out there,” the man said. &nbsp; “We can have it ready by eleven o’clock tomorrow morning.”&nbsp;<br><br>Without our engine we were towed to a very nice campsite. There we were. We were not going anywhere. So the thing to do was to take advantage of the park’s amenities and relax.<br><br>We had visited the Rocky Mountain National Park, the Black Canyon of the Gunnison, the Grand Canyon, and points in between. We had seen the giant monolithic rocks of Zion National Park, the army of red statues silently standing in Brice Canyon National Park and the Alpine-like Grand Tetons. In Yellowstone National Park we had seen geysers, mud pots, hot springs and my all time favorite waterfall, the lower falls of the Yellowstone, where the river drops as a clean white ribbon into the golden gorge it has cut for itself. It was once the poster boy for the Union Pacific Railroad.<br><br>Despite a leisurely pace, visiting these places and a few others had generated some amount of fatigue in all of us. I had arranged our travel so that we arrived at a campground early on each Friday to get a good site ahead of the weekend crowd. On Saturday we did not travel, but instead found the local laundry and a grocery store and just relaxed and cleaned up. We usually traveled again on Sunday.<br><br>We prepared our camp for the night. We explored the park’s amenities and played around. We had a leisurely supper and played around some more. When the tow truck arrived a bit before eleven we were packed and ready to go. A half hour’s work at the garage was all it took before we were ready to resume our journey. As we left Mitchell we all agreed that the folks there had made our stay the most memorable and the most pleasant of our campouts. Our stay turned out to be a welcome respite from our travels.	1	2017-04-21 00:42:45.579802	2017-04-23 00:12:20.276216	2005	3	\N	\N	\N	701	\N	\N
30	Sam	Sam Camper was a craftsman who worked in the sample department at Westinghouse. He had built many sample devices to specifications of engineers of the control section. He frequently suggested better ways of making an item. He was a good-natured man, about twenty years my senior. He was also advisor and consultant to young engineers on almost any subject especially women, sex, and marriage. He had attended my wedding after giving me his unsolicited advice.<br><br>One day during my first year as a newlywed, Sam said, ”Alma and I are going to Michigan for a week. Bring your bride and come along with us. We have cabin in the Upper Peninsula. The fishing is good.”<br><br>“I’d be delighted. It will be fun,” said Mary when I passed the news on to her although she had not met the Campers.<br><br>We were ready to travel early on the appointed day. We made the proper introductions and got into the back seat of the Campers sedan for the all day trip through Michigan. We stopped to see the locks at Sioux Saint Marie on our way, and arrived at the cabin after dark.<br><br>Morning presented us a bright summer day. From our lakeside cabin we saw a placid pool of crystal clear water stretching half a mile beyond our shore. Yon shore was rimmed by a forest of tall pines. The cabin was well located a short walk from the lake. There was ample shade in the yard making it a fine place to just hang around and relax. After a good breakfast Mary and I went for a boat ride until we had had enough sun, then retreated to the shade.<br><br>I had never been successful at fishing, so I was anxious to try my hand at the game with an experienced fisherman.<br><br>“There are bass, walleye and pike in this lake, maybe we can catch some of them,” Sam said in an optimistic tone. He and I tried our hands at fishing on several occasions, but to little avail. We tried this and that spot hoping to snag a big one, but succeeded in catching only a few small perch.&nbsp;<br><br>“Since you guys can’t catch enough fish for a meal,” said Alma, “I think we should go see what else we can find around here.” We all agreed.<br><br>We set out on an exploration tour, heading north. By and by we came upon the “shores of Gitchy Goomy, by the shining big sea water”. Surely, Hiawatha had stood here. The sight was inspiring and the water was cold. We soaked in the beauty of the place for a while and moved on until we came upon a small rail station.<br><br>A narrow gage railroad lay beside the station. Soon an odd-looking train pulled up to the loading platform. The passenger cars were open-topped trams with two benches set back-to-back spanning the length of the car. Arriving passengers got off and we with others boarded the contraption. The little train chugged along a scenic, mostly wooded route for half an hour. At the end of the line we found a well-trodden trail, which we followed for a few hundred yards. The faint roar heard at the outset became ever more distinct as we moved down the trail. We emerged from the woods and, voila! There it was, Tahquamenon Falls.<br><br>A fluid curtain spanned the full width of the river without a rip or tear. Footlights of vapor and spray framed the curtain to render the scene a stage, ready for a show to begin. But there was no need to wait; this was the show. Pretty as it was, this falls had a unique quality. The falls was not white, as are most, but a light tan color. Pools of water below the falls appeared dark brown. The river above the falls flowed through miles of forest where rains soaked tannin from fallen dead leaves before seeping into the river.<br><br>Another day Sam said, “Do you want to catch some fish? Come on we’ll go get some blue gills,” and off we went to a shallow place on the lake where grew reeds and other water plants. We baited our hooks with worms and dipped them into the shallow water. With little delay I caught a sunfish bigger than my hand. Sam did likewise. It wasn’t long before we had caught enough for a good meal. The fish must have been hungry that day. I had never had so much fun fishing. Back at the cabin we spent more time cleaning the fish than it took to catch them. Alma and Mary cooked a good supper featuring the delicious fish.<br><br>“Well, tomorrow we have to head home. What say we take a different way back?” said Sam, “Let’s see what Wisconsin looks like.”<br><br>We all agreed and left early next day. The scenery was pleasant; mostly farms and herds of cows on low rolling hills and flat land. We didn’t find the price of cheese so attractive as imagined. It was near dark when we started looking for a motel. It must have been a less traveled road, for there were none to be found. About eleven o’clock we all began to get sleepy.<br><br>“Has anybody seen a motel?” asked Sam.<br><br>“No!” said Alma, “If we had we’d have told you.”<br><br>“I suppose we ought to look for a place to pull off the road, and maybe we can sleep in the car for a while,” said Sam and he soon turned onto a side road. Not far down that road we saw a country church next to a graveyard.<br><br>“This looks like a quiet place to rest,” said Mary. Sam agreed and parked the car between the church and the graveyard. We all leaned back in our seats and relaxed. Some of us were about to snooze when there was an interruption.<br><br>“Did you hear something out there?” asked Alma.<br><br>“Get out o’ there,” came a voice from the road.&nbsp;<br><br>“Yeah, I heard that,” said Sam, “Do you suppose that’s the sheriff?”<br><br>“GET OUT O’ THERE!” came the voice once more.<br><br>“Must be the sheriff or somebody going to call the sheriff.” Sam started the car and slowly drove to the road. As we proceeded we saw two men walking along, sort of holding each other upright.<br><br>So much for sleep, everybody was wide-awake. Sam just kept on driving and we arrived home early in the day.&nbsp;	1	2017-04-21 00:45:06.273697	2017-04-23 00:12:20.28673	2005	4	\N	\N	\N	1135	\N	\N
22	Canyon	Our four children had been left at home under the charge of their grandmother. Mary needed a change of scenery from everyday chores. We were in Phoenix and planning a tour to the Grand Canyon. It was off-season and the regular tour buses were not in service. A group of six or seven was there for a tour. A limousine was provided and all got aboard headed for the canyon. It was a small and friendly group. A young man from England sat near Mary and conversed with us periodically throughout the trip. I remember only one thing that he said; that he could see that Mary and I loved each other. That warmed my heart, to say the least.<br><br>We took the scenic route through Oak Creek Canyon, where huge red rocks tower above treetops, making a vivid contrast in color and form. Scene after breathtaking scene provided a constantly changing, colorful panorama as we rolled along. A highlight of the tour was the town of Sedona. To a newcomer, it appeared as a town set in a rosy fairyland.<br><br>We arrived at Grand Canyon National Park late in the afternoon. There was time to explore the village grounds and view the canyon a bit before sundown but little else. After we ate our supper and occupied our room for the night, Mary began plotting her plan for the morrow. She had heard correctly that the best time to view the canyon was at sunrise or sunset. Since we missed our chance at sunset that left only one option. I’m sure Mary had checked out the time for sunrise and other pertinent data. She compared time shown by her watch to that by mine.&nbsp;<br><br>“We need to be out on the point before sunrise,” she reminded me after we had turned in for the night.<br><br>“OK, but could we get some sleep first?” I yawned.<br><br>“Does your watch have a luminous dial?” said she.&nbsp;<br><br>“Yes, goodnight,” I said, and soon went to sleep. I don’t know how long it took her to sleep. I was half awakened when my hand was lifted, slightly twisted and laid back down. This type of sleep interruption happened at least twice more, and then I was stirred by a gentle nudge, and a question.<br><br>“What time is it?” she said. I had turned over so that she couldn’t see my watch.<br><br>“ Time for you to go to sleep,” I said. The next time she asked the question she really roused me and told me to get up and get dressed. I obeyed, and we were soon out on a trail in the dark. That was all right; she had a flashlight and I had remembered to bring my camera. The trail was paved, a good thing, but it was all uphill, a bad thing at that altitude. I was not used to walking such walks in my sleep. After a half-mile hike we arrived at the observation point. A mile below the untiring master sculptor was still at work on his unfinished masterpiece, while his chief apprentices, wind and rain, took a break. We arrived none too soon, for daylight was breaking and sun-up would soon follow, hopefully not before I could get my breath. As the darkness gradually dissipated, parts of the great abyss below began to appear in a faint, warm, rosy glow, becoming ever more intense. The source of this glow appeared as an arc of fire, expanding to a full circle over the horizon. Distant canyon walls began to appear, starting at the canyon rim and creeping downward as the circle of fire ascended into the sky. The shadow hiding the canyon walls gradually fragmented to expose an infinity of shapes and hues. The great pyramids of layered rock inside the canyon cast long shadows through the great gorge. On our side of the canyon there were huge boulders, partly covered by many forms of vegetation that seemed to emit their own glow of multihued light, changing from minute to minute.<br><br>It is impossible to describe such a magnificent display of light and form. It is completely different than that seen when the sun is high in the sky. Then the color is a dull red without many defining characteristics. The formations tend to blend together and it becomes a gigantic gash in the earth. At sunrise, however, the scene is enhanced by the light as refracted by the atmosphere that favors the red end of the light spectrum. This gives the scene a mellow ambience and the low aspect of the sun creates shadows and shadings, all of which help define the shape and beauty of the panorama. Viewing the sunrise scene from darkness to the climax of its spectacular beauty gives one an emotional high, as it did me. I felt good throughout my body. I forgave Mary for waking me during the night, as I would be reminded later by the pictures. I felt a little let down when the scene faded, but I took consolation in the thought that tomorrow and tomorrow it would repeat its awesome performance for someone else.	1	2017-04-18 00:44:23.526486	2017-04-23 00:12:20.293656	2005	3	\N	\N	\N	879	\N	\N
31	Scout Camp	Upon leaving the highway it is a short drive following the creek up the hollow to Camp Campbell, the Boy Scout camp. It is a pretty drive through forest and clearings with the creek sometimes roaring, sometimes rippling over rocks, and sometimes running quietly. It fills a boy’s mind with anticipation of things to come.<br><br>At the camp a grassy clearing is surrounded by woods on the slopes of the hollow. Off to the right a good swimming hole has been made by damming the creek followed here. The clearing provides ample room for numerous activities: athletic games, demonstrations, a campfire, and so on. Across the open field, maybe a couple of hundred yards from the swimming hole sits the dining hall, a most favored place of hungry boys after a few hours of activity. The woods have been thinned out along its edges next to the camp, to provide shady space among the trees for the boys’ tents. Wooden platforms serve as tent floors over the sloping, rocky ground. The tents each accommodated eight scouts. A general-purpose lodge sits in the woods beyond the tent area. It can be used for cold weather camping and many other events. Tents for the camp staff are located near the dining hall, which is used also for staff meetings. These tents sit on a steeper slope than the others, requiring about six front steps up to the entrance.<br><br>The swimming hole sports a diving board and stairs for exiting the water. The water is about eight feet deep in the middle. This makes a fine place to practice life saving skills, the toughest part of which is pulling a ten pound rock in a sack from the bottom. Upstream is also a shallow end to the pool.<br><br>In July, 1935, boys from several Boy Scout troops arrived a few at a time for the first week of summer camp. Staff members directed the boys to the dining hall where they registered. Each scout was shown to his tent where he could unpack his gear and choose his bunk. The rest of the afternoon was free time so the boys could get acquainted with one another and explore the camp. Some of the boys hung around their tents and talked. Some used the open space for games. Some checked out the woods around their tents. One picked up a rock in the thinned out woods and discovered a squirmy little ground snake about six inches long. This adventurer was soon joined by a few others picking up rocks and catching the little snakes. They later turned their quarry loose. The fun was in the hunt, not the possession. The swimming hole was opened for a short time during the afternoon for those who wanted to take a dip.<br><br>The dinner bell rang early that day so that the camp director could have time to inform the boys about camp rules and the week’s agenda. The scouts showed up in uniform, displaying their rank and merit badges. It was a fine looking group. The director and a couple of senior staff members were adults. The other staff members were older scouts of varying rank. The camp director introduced the staff members and cited their primary duties. All but one of the staff were veterans of previous camp sessions. Tommy was the new member who arrived at the camp for the first time that afternoon. After finishing his orientation speech the director warned the boys about wandering into the woods; that there are wild animals there.<br><br>“What kind of animals?” a boy asked.<br><br>“Snakes, wildcats and other things,” the director said. “Wildcats prowl at night. It is rumored that there is one cat called Caleb that likes to rip out the seat of a boy’s pants.”<br><br>Caleb was the main topic during supper.&nbsp;<br><br>“Do you think Caleb is around the camp?” one boy said.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>“No,” said another, “It’s a big woods out there.”&nbsp;<br><br>“I heard that he was here last year,” another chimed in. “I also heard that he’s not afraid of anything but water. He won’t go in the water.”<br><br>Murmurs such as these were heard throughout the meal, but they subsided after supper when the scouts gathered for the evening activities. Things went pretty much normally the rest of the evening. The boys retired for the night. Taps sounded and all finally became quiet.<br><br>After awhile the still of the night was broken by a loud wailing, growling noise penetrating the whole camp.<br><br>“Caleb!” someone said, and a bustle was heard at one of the staff tents, followed by a scream and the sound of a splash coming from the swimming hole. Part of the staff rushed to the swimming hole with their flashlights.<br><br>“Tommy, what in the world are you doing in there,” one said.<br><br>“Caleb’s afraid of the water,” said the new staff guy.<br><br>“He’s gone. Come on back to bed,” came the reply. After much persuasion Tommy came out of the water and back to bed. Tommy had a restless night.<br><br>Word of Tommy’s dash and dip was all over camp the next morning. After breakfast a large tin can was found under Tommy’s tent. Attached to the bottom of the can was a well-rosined string. Pulling the string through the fingers set off a weird sound. So! Caleb had not visited after all. Tommy had been the butt of a practical joke, his initiation as a new junior staff member accomplished. Yet, the legend of Caleb was not diminished but lives on to this day.	1	2017-04-21 00:50:13.634209	2017-04-23 00:12:20.300854	2005	1	\N	\N	\N	976	\N	\N
14	Siblings	“Make him quit, Momma.” Words such as these characterize much of my memory of my little sister during our growing years of the 1930’s. Margaret had lots of playmates in our early years, while I had to leave the neighborhood to find boys to play with. As we grew up I had casual friends among the boys, but only Bill Cornn became a close friend. Margaret on the other hand, had a circle of friends whom I perceived to be close friends.&nbsp;<br><br>Studying was never one of my favorite activities. I was always happy to be passed to the next grade at the end of the school year. I was surprised to learn that my little sister was passed not to the next grade, but that she skipped a grade entirely. That made me more envious of her—to have a sister smarter than I. I suspect that envy was one reason I felt compelled to annoy her now and then.&nbsp;<br><br>I had always wanted a brother to play with. Other boys had brothers. What did I have? A little sister who didn’t need my protection. By and by I gave up the idea of a brother. I’d just have to make do with a sister. We did get along together most of the time.&nbsp;<br><br>A month after my twelfth birthday my parents presented me with a brother. He was a big baby, about eleven pounds worth. Here was my brother, but he was about ten years late. I wasn’t as thrilled as others were. What games could I play with a baby? I had longed for a boy we could play ball, explore the woods, swim in the river, who needed a big brother to look out for him. What this kid needed was a nursemaid and later a babysitter.&nbsp;<br><br>My brother was named James Marion Jessee after our two grandfathers. You can guess what famous outlaw inspired Jimmy’s nickname. Jimmy soon grew into a handsome toddler with blond, curly hair. As the toddler grew, so did his hair, with no diminishing of the curls. He was indeed a handsome young lad. Yes—even a pretty one. Certainly his mother concurred in this opinion for he sported his long curly tresses until he was old enough to start school. Momma seemed to grieve over his first boy-style haircut. I often wondered if she secretly wished that he had been born a girl.&nbsp;<br><br>By the time that Jimmy started school I was off to college, and I saw little of him from then on—only on my short visits home from college. I was pretty much too preoccupied with my own concerns to notice what Jimmy was up to. Margaret filled me in on her activities, friends, etc., and what she knew of my classmates.&nbsp;<br><br>Two years after my graduation from high school, Margaret followed. She enrolled in Eastern Kentucky State Teachers College with the idea of teaching school upon graduation, which she did. In a few years she met and married Ray Givens, of Middlesboro, Kentucky. They subsequently moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee. There they both worked in the atomic energy industry until their retirement. Ray worked in one or more of the plants while Margaret worked in the publication arena.<br><br>The Givens’ had two children, Jana, who eventually got tired of being called “Janna” and changed her name to Jayna, and Rick. Jana, the firstborn, came along about ten years after my family was complete. I told Margaret that I had no envy of her future in raising teenagers in her old age. But it seems that they managed all right. It seems that a good deal of their upbringing happened on Norris Lake. Ray almost always owned a boat of one kind or another, which the family used often. Norris Lake was nearby to their home and convenient on weekends. Fishing was a favorite sport.&nbsp;<br><br>Meanwhile, I finished my college career at the University of Kentucky with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering degree. I was immediately hired as a student engineer by Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company. I had three work assignments at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. My fourth and final student assignment took me to Lima, Ohio. All student engineers were encouraged to get off the student course in favor of regular employee status. This, of course, negated the student deferment and subjected us to the draft. World War II had yet a year and a half to last. Before I was really settled into my new job, Uncle Sam said that my number was up. So ended my brief foray into the industrial world. Following basic training at Camp Crowder, Missouri, I was shipped off to Signal Corps training at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Even before I learned Morse code, a physical examination revealed that a lump on my throat was a benign tumor on my thyroid gland. An army surgeon removed it and I was discharged from the army. More than forty years passed before I learned that the surgeon took half my thyroid gland with the tumor.&nbsp;<br><br>After serving eight months in the army I made my way back to Lima to resume my chosen career as an engineer. There I met Mary Werff, a comely young woman whom I courted for a year. We were married and raised a family of four children.&nbsp;<br><br>Back to brother, Jimmy.&nbsp; I know very little about his life as a school boy. I have the impression from my parents that Jimmy was a kid filled by wanderlust. He showed up at my house in Lima for a short stay. Shortly thereafter, at age 15, he married a girl of his age from Covington, Kentucky. In 1953 or ’54 Jimmy brought his family, Peggy, I believe, and two daughters for a visit with us in Lima. About all I remember about the visit is that it was pleasant and that his daughters, Carrol Ann and Bobbie (Barbra) were about the ages of my daughters, Catherine and Susanna. They played together in the backyard on a summer day. Jimmy moved his family to California where they had another child, Mike. On a business trip in 1959 to Los Angeles, I stayed over to visit them. Jimmy was not home and Peggy didn’t know where he was. While there I got word that our mother had died. I cut short my visit and went to her funeral. Jimmy never showed. I never heard from him after that for many years.<br><br>It is my belief that Jimmy and Dad had some disagreement, probably about money, though I don’t know. I do know that many years passed without any of the family hearing from him. It was not until after Dad’s estate was settled that it was possible to find him. I suppose the banking system found him.&nbsp;<br><br>Margaret got in touch with our brother and later she and Ray paid him and his third wife, Dorothy, a visit at their Northridge, California home. Soon after, we began to correspond by greeting card. Meanwhile I had married my third wife, Dorothy Phillips.&nbsp;<br><br>My Dorothy and I were on a trip to New England when we got word from Margaret that Jim and Dorothy were touring North Carolina, looking for a retirement home, and world stop in Oak Ridge for a visit. We were invited to join the visit. We cut short our vacation trip and headed home via Oak Ridge.<br><br>Meeting my brother for the first time in some forty years was somewhat awkward, but entirely welcome and congenial. Our Dorothys became friends quickly. His became Dorothy-I and mine, Dorothy-II—to avoid confusion, of course. Dorothy I was the first of the two to become a Jessee. Jim was a distinguished looking man, lightly bearded, about 6’4’’ tall and outweighing me by at least 60 pounds. His curls were long gone, of course, replaced by a shiny pate. He spoke well and made a good impression, apparently recovered from a wild midlife which I credit mostly to Dorothy-I. Dorothy-I was a good-looking woman of slight build and good personality a few years younger than Jim. On this occasion we all talked and brought each other up to date on our present lives. It was a grand reunion which ended too soon for us all.&nbsp;<br><br>Ray and Margaret had joined Dorothy and me on resort vacations in the North Carolina mountains and at a beach resort in Georgia (At Tybee Island, Georgia, we provided them a room with twin beds. As if used by newlyweds, one bed was never used.) Ray was always anxious to get back home. Nevertheless, we had a good time on our outings. We had planned another resort vacation, but this one was different. Jim and Dorothy-I were to be there. They flew in from California and the rest of us went in Ray’s van from Oak Ridge. We met at a beautiful resort in Flagstaff, Arizona for our reunion. We had a week to see the sights and get better acquainted. We did the usual tourist things: toured the Grand Canyon, Petrified Forest, Painted Desert, Sedona (Dorothy-I’s favorite), etc. Ray rode a mule down the canyon slope and back. We had only one casualty on our tours. While walking a trail having very sharp volcanic ash and stones, Jim stumbled over a rock and fell forward, suffering some bad scratches and skin punctures. Both my siblings had developed diabetes and as a result, Jim had little or no feeling in his feet. That made the trail treacherous for him. Fortunately, the injury was not serious. Nevertheless Dorothy-I was quite concerned for him for awhile.&nbsp;<br><br>Jim’s son Mike, of Salt Lake City, joined us at our villa on two or three days with his wife and daughter. We all talked and laughed together. We had a good time learning about each other. Jim had studied and practiced engineering over the years. Dorothy worked for a university. In a conversation one day my brother said to me that I had been his hero, or words to that effect. I was dumbfounded. I had never thought of myself as having had any influence on him, much less anything deserving such high praise. His confession truly surprised me.&nbsp; I could muster only a simple “Thank you”. I can’t remember more of the conversation.&nbsp;<br><br>We all had a great week. We got along like a good family and all agreed that it was a worthwhile experience. On reflection, I shouldn’t have been surprised at Jim’s attitude toward me. After all I was his big brother, and even though we had scant contact while he was growing up, he still saw me as some kind of example.&nbsp;<br><br>Jim and Dorothy moved to Fredericksburg, Texas to make their retirement home. I think they made a garden for their enjoyment. They lived there for two or three years before Jim had a massive heart attack while walking their dog. Dorothy made a memorial for Jim in their garden, I believe. It became apparent to me that Jim and Dorothy really loved each other.&nbsp;<br><br>Margaret and I still survive. We learned to appreciate our brother. I had very much looked forward to more reunions with him, but now that will have to wait.	1	2017-04-18 00:26:31.961494	2017-04-23 00:12:20.308145	2005	1	\N	\N	\N	1948	\N	\N
15	Thanksgiving	“Is everybody ready to go? David, you and Stephen, get your coats on and don’t forget your hats,” said Mary, noting that Susanna and Catherine were ready to go. We all got into the car and started off.<br><br>“Over the river and through the woods to grandmother’s house we go ----“, sang the children as we drove away. The river was very small, and there were no woods at all. But that made no difference to the singers. They had the spirit of the day.<br><br>Granny’s house was an ordinary one, similar in looks to many others in the neighborhood, only a good bit older. The house sat on a plot of about five acres. A small stream split the plot, with an apple orchard one side, the house on the other. Granny’s summer flower garden, then just dry sticks, lay between the house and the stream. A row of young walnut trees lined the other side of the house, separated by a driveway. Behind the house were her tool shed and her vegetable garden space.<br><br>We parked in the driveway, got out and climbed four or five steps to the front porch and went in. We were greeted with the aroma of good things cooking as soon as we opened the door. Inside we found Mary’s sister Ruth and the other Taylors, Bob and kids Rebecca and Bill, with Homer the dog. Granny, a widow named Bess, was in the kitchen and was soon joined by the pair of daughters. Bye and bye, Mary’s brother Bob Werff, better known to the family as Petie, with wife Alberta and son Gary, all arrived with appetites. The family had all gathered. Lots of questions and answers ensued about what everybody had been doing. Shortly the conversation hushed at the announcement that dinner was almost ready. A lightly browned turkey sat on the table for everyone to see. Then it was whisked away to the kitchen. It was expedient to carve the bird in the kitchen. “Ready!” came the welcome word, and the gang assembled to partake of the beast.<br><br>“Our God, we thank you for-----”, Granny began, and my own thoughts took over. I’m thankful for all the things I like, and maybe some things I don’t.<br><br>I like turkey, but prefer steak. I like cranberry relish with my turkey. I like sweet potatoes, apple pie, apple blossoms, and apples. I like beer with my pizza. In short, I like good food.<br><br>I like to walk in the woods, along easy trails where a brook flows and wild flowers bloom. I like being surrounded by mountains. I like to visit waterfalls and feel their cool spray on a hot day, to watch the intricate patterns the water forms during freefall after its impact with an object such as a rock.<br><br>I like the infinite sounds of a symphony orchestra playing the music of the master composers<br><br>I like the presence of family. It is a great feeling to be near loved ones.<br><br>“----Amen”&nbsp;<br><br>As in most every family Thanksgiving dinner, everyone ate until he was stuffed. After dinner the usual slothfulness set in and nothing important happened. Finally commotion of the kids got somebody’s attention.<br><br>”Line up on the couch,” the photographer instructed. After a lot of rearranging the group was all set. Seven small bodies sat side by side looking reasonably happy, except for the kid on the end. Gary would have no part of it. He hollered and cried as if he were being tortured. We got the picture anyway. A year later the same Thanksgiving scene was repeated, including a picture of the kids. To our amazement the picture was the same, except that the crying one was three years old rather than two.<br><br>The Thanksgiving dinner was an annual event until Granny moved to a small apartment in town. She had gotten a job after Petie got married and moved out. Feeling her place was too much to care for alone, she sold it and moved to the apartment.<br><br>Mary decided that since her mother could not have a dinner for a gang in her small apartment that the gang should come to our house for dinner. The next Thanksgiving day they all showed up at our house. The main difference that I noticed was that soon after dinner Petie and Alberta left because they had to go and eat Thanksgiving dinner again at her mother’s house, while the rest of us hung around and ate leftovers.<br><br>Mary’s invitation lead to an annual event for her siblings and their families. Each year the gang came, except for the year that the Taylors were in El Paso. It puzzled me that neither of Mary’s siblings ever thought of inviting their mother and their sister to a Thanksgiving dinner.	1	2017-04-18 00:28:09.311269	2017-04-23 00:12:20.324888	2005	3	\N	\N	\N	841	\N	\N
18	Betty Jean	“Could I chew your gum for a while?” a voice behind me asked as I was getting a drink at the water fountain.<br><br>“What?” I replied. This was a new experience in my young life.<br><br>“Can I chew your gum?” It was Betty Jean. She had apparently seen my jaw moving as she had followed down the hall between classes.<br><br>“Sure, here go ahead and enjoy it. I’m just about done with it,” I said, taking the wad from my mouth and handing it to her. She popped it into her mouth.<br><br>“Thanks,” she said as she started toward her next class. “I’ll give it back to you later.”<br><br>“No need,” I said and went on to my next class.<br><br>Betty Jean was a half grade ahead of me in high school, so we didn’t have any classes together. Our school was organized such that children who were not quite six years old in the fall could start in the winter, half way through the school year. I was only casually acquainted with her. Betty Jean may have been only half a grade ahead of me in school, but she was two or three grades ahead in other ways. She chewed my gum on several other occasions and we had time to talk during the transactions. She was, in the modern tongue, coming on to me. Of course, like all teenagers I liked the attention.<br><br>One day, several years earlier, a buddy and I went to a lake near town to go swimming. The problem was that I couldn’t swim. We played around in the water near the shore for a while when I realized I was alone. All the other kids were on a platform perhaps forty yards from shore. I wanted to be with the gang and started wading out to join them. Of course the water became deeper as I went. I had no fear that the water was up to my chin. My feet were still on the bottom and the platform was in reach. I climbed the ladder and pulled myself aboard. I sat down to enjoy the warm sunshine with the other kids. After a while, having dried off I got up and moved around a bit. I stopped at the edge of the platform doing nothing in particular. The next thing I knew I received a gentle nudge and fell into the water. I was on the deep side where the bottom was further from the surface than my feet would reach. I flailed around but could not stay above the surface.<br><br>“That damn fool’s drownin’,” I heard Woody say. Then there was a splash in the water next to me. A hand grabbed my arm and guided me to a ladder. After a little coughing and sputtering I climbed back to the platform. Thanks to Woody’s quick action I hadn’t inhaled any water. Betty Jean apologized profoundly for pushing me in. She had been playing a boisterous game by seeing that no one stayed dry very long. I didn’t blame her at all. It was my own fault. I shouldn’t have been out there before I could swim. I made sure I learned to swim before the summer was over. This was the first encounter with Betty Jean that I can remember.&nbsp;<br><br>“Why would she pay attention to me?” I wondered. “Hey, you’re on the football team: anything else? What the heck, that’s enough.”&nbsp;<br><br>We met in the hall between classes and talked, chewing gum or not. Sometimes I walked her home from school. Sometimes we went to the soda shop about two blocks from school. Several kids gathered there after school to hang out and listen to the jukebox and maybe dance.<br><br>Some of my peers seemed to think I was running with the fast crowd, and I was warned not to be a sucker. Information I didn’t know about Betty Jean was offered. For example, she had been going with a fellow in the neighboring town of Middlesboro and that they had broken up. She would surely go back to him soon. None of this bothered me. I thought of Betty Jean as a lonely girl who needed a friend. I felt the need, too. So we continued to be chums together. We never had a real date.<br><br>In my senior year our football team was doing well and so was I until in a big game my teammate and I tackled the ball carrier simultaneously from opposite sides. Our momentum caused a secondary collision between teammates and my leg was broken. That ended my football career.<br><br>During my three-week hospital stay friends from school came to visit often. On one of her visits, Betty Jean brought me a beautifully illustrated little book, “The Story of Ferdinand”. It was a joy to read. I read it over and over until I memorized it. Each time I read it I saw something in an illustration I had missed before. Being confined at home for a long time, I didn’t see much of Betty Jean after that. She finished school in the winter. I was still there without her. So far as I know she and her friend in Middlesboro got back together.<br><br>Years later I took the Ferdinand book off the shelf to read to one of my small children. Inside the front cover was a signature, “B. J. Byrley”. It occurred to me for the first that the book had not been a gift, just a loan.&nbsp;<br><br>“If I ever find out where she is I’ll get it back to her”, I said. Forty-nine years after we finished high school a reunion was being planned.&nbsp;<br><br>“Ah, “ I thought, “I’ll give it to her at the reunion,”<br><br>Then a report came in the mail from the reunion committee listing the attendees. I looked for Betty Jean on the list. Her name was not there. Alas, I found her name in the deceased list. So I can’t deliver the book. I still have the book. It brings fond memories of Betty Jean.	1	2017-04-18 00:37:12.967469	2017-04-23 00:12:20.33184	2005	2	\N	\N	Non-Fiction	1064	\N	\N
20	Birth Pains	Mothers are a hardy breed. After going through the discomfort and pain of bearing their young they then have to nourish and care for the babies until they can care for themselves. Of course some mothers are irresponsible, in which case the rule does not apply. In many species the sire of the offspring merely plants his seed and is absent until the next mating season; not so with responsible homosapiens. Some say that only the mother has birth pains. I say fathers also have birth pains. Consider the case of Daddy D.<br><br>Daddy D had been a patient husband, treating his wife with kindness and respect. She was due to deliver her baby any day. Do you think the baby co-operated in this venture? Not unless you consider three AM as day. They headed for St. Rita’s hospital at that hour on the coldest morning of the entire year. A nurse took the wife into what they called a labor room and directed Daddy D to a small waiting room where sat some men with uneasy looks. It was no lounge, just a plain room with straight chairs, a few magazines and a couple of ashtrays. Soon one got up and walked around and sat back down again. Then another followed suit. Six or seven hours passed during which time one or two of the men were called out, and Daddy D joined the others in the pacing game.&nbsp;<br><br>“It’s a boy,” a nurse said to Daddy D, much to his relief, “Congratulations, You may see them now,” and led them to their room.<br><br>“Meet your new son,” said Momma M, “ Isn’t he beautiful?”<br><br>“Uh huh,” said the proud Daddy D, but thinking, “ How could such a pretty young woman have such a ratty looking child?”<br><br>After hanging around until a nurse hauled the baby off to the nursery, Daddy D partook of some of the infamous hospital food, and on his way out stopped for a look in the nursery. What he saw was a room full of ratty looking babies, his own not nearly the worst of them. As he walked to his car to go home he felt better about his new son’s looks.<br><br>Daddy D’s trip was postponed, for alas the cold night had taken its toll on the battery. It took him two or three hours to over come this obstacle, and got home for a much needed nap.<br><br>On homecoming day Momma M was having some trouble in putting a diaper on the baby. She had one hand under the baby’s butt while trying to put the diaper under him with the other. Daddy had to show her how to use the built-in handles that looked like legs to lift his butt.<br><br>Nevertheless they got him home all right.&nbsp;<br><br>Grandma came to stay a few days to help out. This worked fine until the baby was put to bed for the night. He must have had a burp trapped, for he cried when put down. Grandma picked him up and burped him and all was quiet until he was put back in his crib. It was tolerable until repeat performances occurred the next two nights. Then it became annoying. Daddy said that the kid was spoiled already.	1	2017-04-18 00:39:59.609085	2017-04-23 00:12:20.338808	2005	2	\N	\N	Non-Fiction	570	\N	\N
23	Bulldog	Once upon a time in Baum Hollow (pronounced by the natives as “BUM Holler”), there lived a tiny lad, name of ”Bulldog”. Well, his momma and pappy didn’t name him “Bulldog” when first they laid eyes on him. No, that name came on him later…&nbsp;<br><br>Bum Holler was not a thriving community, but a not-so-wide spot in the road where the lad’s grandpa farmed a piece of bottomland and the adjacent hillsides. Bulldog’s family had built a small house a little less than a furlong down the road from Grandpa’s log house. Being the first grandchild, the lad was highly respected and admired and even called by his proper name, Ralph Donald. His aunts and uncles no doubt spoiled him too much. Nevertheless, the boy was a shy child. One day an aunt who thought he would be pretty as a girl conned the lad into the dress-up game. Things went all right until an ornery uncle, a teenager, came upon the scene. The mood changed at once from feminine adoration to brutal teasing. Uncle Ornery insisted on proof that there was a new girl in the family. Sneaking a peek under the skirt embarrassed Ralph Donald so that right then he decided he would never again masquerade as a girl.&nbsp; Is it any wonder that the guy was shy?&nbsp;<br><br>The summer before Ralph Donald was to start first grade, Uncle Ornery and friends began to talk about how school took away the freedom of leisure that young folks enjoyed; how one had to obey the teacher, study and all sorts of strange things. There were no kindergartens in those days except perhaps for kids of rich parents who wanted to get their kids out from underfoot. So it was a big jump into a strange world. As the day drew nearer, Uncle and company would say, “It won’t be long now”. Someone found a cartoon showing a monkey about to get his tail chopped off and read the caption, “It won’t be long now”. By now the little lad was quite apprehensive about school.&nbsp;<br><br>But the day arrived and Mom took her little boy to school and after enrolling him went back home to her duties. After all, she had a genuine little girl to care for.&nbsp;<br><br>Things went smoothly in first grade class for much of the morning. Miss Flannery executed her lesson plan. A great deal of the spoken word goes unnoticed by young minds. It’s not clear whether or not potty location and protocol were verbally explained. It is certain, however, that no physical show-and-tell was conducted.&nbsp; Ralph Donald was ignorant about what to do when “nature calls” in these strange surroundings. He had been told to mind the teacher. He hoped for an early recess but to no avail.&nbsp; Nature won’t be denied for long and finally won, while the poor boy sat paralyzed. The mile walk home after school seemed much longer than it really was. Feet seemed to get heavier with each step. The lad had to face Mom, but he took some consolation in the knowledge that he had gained that day.<br><br>Things went fairly well for the next several months, except that Ralph Donald’s mind wandered now and then. He would much rather be in the woods with his uncle gathering chestnuts and persimmons or perhaps wading in a creek or riding grandpa’s sweaty horse back from a day ploughing.<br><br>In spring, boys would rather play marbles during recess. Ralph Donald looked on and decided it looked like fun. He managed to acquire a few pennies and bought some pea jibs, clay orbs not quite round, at the candy store, and joined the boys in a game. He enjoyed his turn at trying to knock a few marbles out of the ring. When it came his turn again there were none left to shoot at. To begin the next game the boys demanded he put more marbles in the ring, but he had no more. That’s when he learned about playing for keeps, a rude awakening. This brought tears to the lad’s eyes and a distraught look, with a wide down-turned mouth. One of the boys saw the face as the look of a bulldog, and did not hesitate to say so. Others in the gang agreed and the name “Bulldog” was born.&nbsp;<br><br>Bulldog most certainly was not pleased with the name, not because of the name itself, but because it reminded him that his peers thought of him as a crybaby. He was stuck with the name. Fortunately not everyone called him Bulldog and he adapted to his situation.<br><br>Because of the great depression Bulldog’s family moved to a town in another state were nobody knew him as Bulldog. He was happy for that. No one called him Bulldog again. He went on to be known by a variety of other nicknames, which was all right because he had matured a bit. He had learned one important lesson from the “bulldog” incident; to never play a game until you learn the rules.	1	2017-04-18 23:22:28.150359	2017-04-23 00:12:20.34551	2004	1	\N	\N	Non-Fiction	879	\N	\N
41	Sara Bess	There was a tap, tap, tap. The sound was coming from the water pipes in the house. I got up and responded to the sound with my own taps on the plumbing, and walked out the front door. Sara Bess and I had concocted a private communication scheme. The country was still in the great depression and my family had not the luxury of a telephone and no phone bills, of course. I made my way up the hill to the house next door where I found Sara Bess sitting on the porch waiting for me.<br><br>"Hi,” she said, “Did you bring your book?”<br><br>“Yes ma'am,” I said, and sat down beside her. “Do you remember the assignment?”<br><br>She remembered, but before we went inside to study we were compelled to sit a while and cuddle and woo. Eventually we did go in and study our French assignment.<br><br>French? Why in the world was I studying French? I really had no interest in French, or any other foreign language. My interests lay in mathematics, science, etc. Anyone could guess the reason. I had found that Sara Bess was signing up for the course.<br><br>There were several attractive girls in my class. After the class advanced to high school I began to take more interest in them. There was a certain mystery about them that I wanted to learn more about. A good deal of that mystery lingers yet. Sara Bess had been in my class all along. For some odd reason I became more interested in her than in any other. She wasn’t the fairest damsel there. I was more than a foot taller than she, and her protruding chin looked odd, but I thought she was cute. I was a shy guy and I wanted her to think of me as her guy, but I was hesitant to move.<br><br>Soon after my newfound interest, my family moved from the flood plain to the mountainside. I was ecstatic, because I found that Sara Bess lived in the house next door. This would surely make it easier for me to get acquainted with her.<br><br>I quickly learned to give up my habit of getting to school in just the nick of time. Sara Bess usually got there ten minutes early. I had to be ready to leave home sooner, so as to be able to “happen” to meet her on the way to school. After a while walking together became natural, sometimes even holding hands. In time we were hanging around together on her front porch in the evenings. When the weather cooled she invited me inside. We had become a couple, or as they say these days, an item. Once we had discovered that noises in our plumbing systems could be heard in both houses we decided on our taping arrangement which we used for other than academic purposes.&nbsp;<br><br>Things went well for a couple of years, then during our senior year an intruder appeared on the scene. I suspect he first showed up while I was honing my football skills on the gridiron. I learned when I saw him pass my house one evening, that he was Charles Roach. I was acquainted with Roach. We had been in the same Boy Scout troop. He was a good-looking boy, so I could see why a girl might be attracted to him. I had serious reservations about his honesty, however, because I had seen him cheat on several occasions in scout activities. I cautioned Sara Bess to be sure she could trust him. She probably thought it was my jealousy talking.<br><br>Occasionally when I asked to see her, Sara Bess would say that she was busy. So I began to see her less often. Word of this got around among our peers. Our class crystal-ball-gazer looked ten years into the future.<br><br>“Donald Jessee and his wife, Sara Bess, are taking a world cruise so that Sara Bess can forget Charles Roach,” she said.<br><br>During the summer after graduation I not only saw less of her, but her ardor had cooled a good deal. She was surely smitten by the Roach.<br><br>In the fall Sara Bess went to Milligan College and I enrolled at Lincoln Memorial University. I met several new girls at college. Some were interesting and fun to be with, but I could not forget Sara Bess, so off I went to Milligan College to see her. We had a friendly visit, but she wasn’t her former self. I concluded that she had chosen Roach as her favorite guy. So ended the first romance of a young lover.<br><br>Fifty years later at the class reunion I was excited to see Sara Bess again. She was the only classmate that I recognized. She attended the event with her husband, a retired navy officer. Our meeting was much more cordial than had been our last meeting at Milligan College. At dinner we reviewed major events in our lives over the past half-century. She told of how her first husband, Dr. Charles Roach, walked out and left her with four children to raise.&nbsp;<br><br>“You were right,” she said, "I should have listened to you.”&nbsp;<br><br>Regrets? Perhaps, but she seemed contented with her current life.	1	2017-04-21 01:17:51.628106	2017-04-23 00:12:20.359216	2005	2	\N	\N	\N	907	\N	\N
43	Stage Career	They were truly dragging the bottom of the barrel. Why else should they be trying to recruit young engineers at the local Westinghouse plant? There was no other answer.<br><br>A group of would-be thespians formed a little theater organization in the late 1930’s. They called the organization Amil Tellers, named after their hometown by spelling Lima backwards. They had been given the use of an abandoned carriage house. The building was dubbed Stable Gables, and used as a theater for several years. During WWII the owner reclaimed Stable Gables and converted it into a residence. Amil Tellers was without a home. Despite this and a shortage of male members it survived by producing plays wherever they could find a suitable place for a performance.<br><br>One of their members who worked at Westinghouse was charged with recruiting men to try out for roles in a new play.<br><br>“Were you ever in a play?” the recruiter asked one day.<br><br>“A couple of times in high school,” I said.<br><br>“We’re putting on a play in a month or so and we need actors to fill the cast,” he said. “Come on down and try out. You’ll have a lot of fun. It’s a fun group.”<br><br>“I’m no actor,” I said, “I hate memorizing stuff.”<br><br>“Come down just for the fun of it. You won’t have to take a part. You’ll just read a part of the script if you want to,” he said.<br><br>There was an abundant supply of women at the try-out meeting. The men were scarce, barely enough to fill the cast. Everyone appeared to be relaxed and having a good time, except for me, of course. Dick Reeder, the new director, gave everyone a chance to read a part, and then selected people to read particular parts. I nervously read a couple of parts, hoping another man would show up. None did. Before the session was over Dick announced his choice for the cast.<br><br>“Don,” he said, “I want you to take the part of Bart Jessop.”<br><br>“Uh,” I gulped.<br><br>Somebody passed out script books, rehearsal schedules, and other instructions. We were all encouraged to memorize our lines as soon as possible. It was a policy of the Tellers to do plays without a prompter. So knowing one’s lines was important. Sometimes a lapse of memory could cause skipping a few pages of script and confuse not only the cast, but also the audience.<br><br>The play is about a murder that happens late at night, in view of the audience. Bart Jessop is a member of the local constabulary, an inept one, which gives the play a bit of humor. Bart muddles through, adding his confusion until a sharp detective comes on the scene to straighten out the matter.<br><br>During the next month I discovered that the free time I once enjoyed had vanished like a morning fog. Time away from my job found me reading my playbook. I became a nuisance to my wife by having her coach me, by having her read my cues, listening to me recite lines. I went to the rehearsals where we acted our movements on stage with book in hand. I began to think of myself as Bart Jessop, acting out parts of my role. My wife began to think of me as she would of a bad cold, “It’s not fatal, but I’ll sure be glad when it’s over.”<br><br>“Next rehearsal, we’ll do it without books,” Dick said one night. This was the moment I had dreaded, for I wasn’t sure I knew all my lines and cues. I didn’t, but I still had time.<br><br>As the cast gathered for the performance my anxiety was tempered by the thought that once it was over, I could forget having to memorize stuff. Even so, stage fright gripped me as soon as the play started, though I didn’t appear until the second act. When my time arrived I sort of vibrated my way on stage. Once I delivered my first line my stage fright stopped being a problem, as with real actors. The play went on as intended. That pleased our audience, our director and the cast.<br><br>The most memorable thing about the performance was to me the curtain call. The cast lined up on stage with the murder victim at one end and the perpetrator at the other. Each held a calla lily in his hands over his chest.<br><br>About a week after the play ran, the draftsman who was working with me called me to come and check on our project. We looked at his work and found it to be on target. When I looked up, I was surrounded by draftsmen.<br><br>“Attention everyone.” a familiar voice said, “In recognition of his sterling performance, and his bravery in facing an audience, I present you this token of our esteem. Display this sterling trophy in a place of honor.”<br><br>“Thank you,” I said, while thinking. “What a pile of horse hockey. I’ll bet no one here even saw the play.” Nevertheless, I felt flattered that my peers would even think of me.<br><br>The trophy was something else again. It was modeled after a cartoon character, one of the mountain boys. He sat on a stump in the pose of the famous “The Thinker”, feet apart, elbow on one knee, chin on his right hand and his left arm resting on his leg. Except for a fringe, his head was bald, but not so his chin, from which hung a long beard. Of course, he wore bib overalls, too short, thus displaying his bare feet. The piece was sculpted from modeling clay and was finished in a bright coat of aluminum paint. This was truly one of a kind original. I accepted it with pleasure, took it home and found a prominent place to display it. I appreciated it, even as an object of satire.<br><br>My career as a thespian was at an end. The stress was more than I wanted to tolerate. However, I remained a fan and supporter of the Tellers, and attended their plays when I could, especially after they got their own theater a few years later.<br><br>While I waited to present my ticket for a performance, a voice boomed out, and I turned to see its source.<br><br>“Don’t touch that body,” it had said.<br><br>“Wib Smale,” I replied, “I see you’re still working here.” Wib had been the stage manager for “my” play. “Don’t touch that body” was Bart Jessop’s most emphatic line, and I had forgotten it. Echoes of voices from the past jog the memory.	1	2017-04-21 01:20:02.910714	2017-04-23 00:12:20.387113	2006	5	\N	\N	\N	1166	\N	\N
61	Solitary Hike	“Momma, I’m gonna take a little hike up the mountain if you don’t mind. OK?”<br><br>“Are goin’ by yourself?”<br><br>“Yes maam. I’m only goin’ where I’ve been before.”<br><br>“All right, but be careful.”<br><br>“I’ll be back by supper time.”<br><br>I go straight up the mountainside. I wish there were a better trail. That’s OK. It’s steep but I’ll make it. Kind of slick here. There’s a root I can grab onto. I must’ve come up a thousand feet by now. Oh well, I’m half way to the top. Stop and rest for a minute. Good, there’s some huckleberries. They taste pretty good. Well, press on. Path’s kind of rocky ahead. Not so steep now, must be near the top. Ah, there’s the crest trail; I made it.<br><br>This is a pretty nice trail. I’ll bet the CCC made it or at least improved it. I’ll walk out toward the chained rock. Feels nice up here, cooler, a little breeze. Helps dry off the sweat I worked up. I see a big rock ahead, think it’s the one they call Turtle Back. Yep. Strange looking. Shaped like a turtle all right, a mighty big turtle. Looks like it was etched, leaving plateaus of rock all over it. Wonder what caused that kind of erosion. Down the trail a way is the overhanging rock that my buddy Jimmy and I slept under that night. Still sandy under the rock.<br><br>Some massive boulders just ahead. The biggest one is mostly buried, but it looks like a couple of acres exposed as bare rock. One boulder protrudes out over the valley below. That’s the chained rock. Some clever politician must have thought up that scheme. Has to be big enough to be seen from the town. Wonder how many mules it took to drag that fifty-foot long chain up here. It’s attached to the rock by just a steel rod driven into the rock. But I didn’t come up here to inspect the chain; I came to smell the woods, to hear a bird sing, to feel the breeze and to enjoy the scenery. I’m gonna sit down and do all these things now for a little while, then I’ll head back to civilization and supper. This solitary hike has sharpened my appetite.<br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:05:10.006935	2017-04-23 00:12:20.393903	2007	2	\N	\N	\N	417	\N	\N
80	Dinah (her version)	My name is Dinah. Mercy, was I cold! I was chilled to the bone. I couldn’t stop shivering. It was so dark that I thought my eyes had sealed shut again. My brothers were on both sides of me. They were so quiet. After a long time I heard voices and then I saw light. We were in a box and somebody took off the lid.<br><br>“This one is alive,” one of the voices said, “Call Mardelle. She said she would be a foster mother to infants until they were big enough for adoption.”<br><br>Someone wrapped me in a blanket to try to warm me but I still shivered and shook. Soon a lady came and took me away. She made a bed for me in the kitchen and then fixed a bottle of warm milk for me to suck at through a nipple. I was still shivering so, that I could barely get a taste. After a while the kitchen door opened and in walked a big guy.<br><br>“What’s this?” he said, and without waiting for an answer looked at me. The lady told him that someone found me in a shoebox with three dead brothers. She said that she would take care of me. I was still shivering even with the heating pad under my bed. The guy picked me up. I just fit in his hand. He sat down and held me against his warm belly. That felt so good that I soon quit shivering so much. He held me for maybe half an hour. My bed felt warmer when he put me back there. Every evening he held me against his warm belly for a while. In about a week my shivering stopped.<br><br>One day I heard the lady say that a vet she knew a couple who were looking for a replacement for their dead dog. I surely hoped they didn’t want me. I liked it here.<br><br>“You know, I kind of like this little dog,” The guy said. That was music to my cute little ears and I stayed on my best behavior.<br><br>“I’ll call the vet and tell her that we decided to keep the dog.” Said the lady.<br><br>They discussed a name for me. They both liked “Dinah”, although the lady had some reservations because it sounded like a name for a Negro kitchen maid. It suited me just fine. I couldn’t see why anyone should object.<br><br>I grew up to be a cute little foot-high, cuddly, long-bodied, short-legged dog with long, black wavy hair. I adored my people, especially the guy. I loved to greet him at the door when he came home from work.&nbsp;<br><br>I thought I should have some responsibility, so when I was allowed out of the house I guarded the territory. I didn’t accept strangers kindly. I never threatened them; only let my people know that they were there. Cats and dogs were a different story. Most cats were easy. A little bluster and they were gone. One black cat confused me. I’d try to chase him off and he would stop and turn around and just look at me. I think he wanted to play. I satisfied myself with just a nose-to-nose greeting.<br><br>A big old collie lived just down the road. He walked past our house several times a day. I noticed him using our lawn as a road. I told him that this was my territory. After a few scoldings he got the message and used the opposite side of the road to pass.<br><br>It turned out to be a bad day when I was with the guy while he was trimming bushes beside the house. I saw this German shepherd in a neighbor’s yard. I said the wrong thing to him and he ran over and bit me. The guy ran him off and tended my wound, which wasn’t bad. I was more careful of what I said after that. Anyway, the shepherd moved away from the neighborhood soon after that.<br><br>Perhaps my most rewarding job was that of being the chief assistant kitchen mop. It was an easy job, and important too. All I needed do was to hang around nearby while the cook fixed the meals, and later while they ate. I wasn’t always needed, but often enough to demand my services. I loved my work when a bit of gravy was dropped.<br><br>One day the guy called me to the back yard and showed me a soft place in the lawn. He said that there was a mole under the grass. I sniffed around a while and started digging at what I thought was the right spot. In a minute I got hold of the varmint and shook the life out of him. I looked around for another, but never found one. I really had a good time rooting him out.<br><br>There are only a couple of things that I’m really afraid of. One is that noise I hear when it rains sometimes. I think they call it thunder. I don’t know where it comes from but it seems that the house is falling and I have to get under something safe. I also worry if the guy is gone a long time. When he comes back I make a pest of myself following him around. I don’t want him out of my sight.<br><br>I guess I bonded with him when I was only a baby and he held me close to his warm body when I was so cold. He will be my idol for as long as I live.	1	2017-04-22 16:31:52.606237	2017-04-23 00:12:20.366233	2005	4	puppy2.jpg	\N	\N	975	\N	\N
42	Sheriff's Dilemma	The elevator door opened. Sergeant O’Neal stepped out with his dog, trained to sniff out explosives. They headed straight to Sheriff Tate’s office and entered.<br><br>“Good morning Sheriff, said O’Neal.<br><br>“Good day O’Neal, I hope you’re bringing good news this time,” said the sheriff.<br><br>“I’m afraid it’s not so good, Sheriff,” said O’Neal, “We’ve searched every day for a blessed week now, and we aint found nothin’.”<br><br>”Nothing?”<br><br>“No sir. Mike and Tom have had the two other dogs out and we’ve covered every inch of the terminal.”<br><br>“Did the other dogs sniff out the areas where your dog had been?”<br><br>“Yes sir.”<br><br>“Did your dog sniff out everywhere the others had been?”<br><br>“Yes sir.”<br><br>“And none of you ever found anything?” said Sheriff Tate, becoming a bit irritated. The sheriff was ordinarily a mild mannered man and slow to anger, but his face had become flushed.<br><br>“The dogs found a few benign things like someone’s unfinished lunch, and a dirty diaper,” said O’Neal.<br><br>“My god, it’s a hell of a note when you can’t find an explosive you know is there. It’s not like some nut called in a false report. Try one more time, O’Neal. That’s all. This damned test is going drive me crazy. Get me Airport Security on the phone,” Sheriff Tate said.<br><br>Later the same day two airport security guards, Joe and Charlie, showed up at the sheriff’s office. They entered the office not knowing why they had been summoned.<br><br>“Hello Sheriff,” they both said.<br><br>“Hello men. Sit down. You know we’re running a test case on our ability to recover bombs that could be planted in the airport. So far we’re not doing so well. Are you the men who were assigned to plant a small box of explosive material in the terminal?” the sheriff said.<br><br>“Yes sir,” said Joe. “We were the ones. That was a couple of weeks ago.”<br><br>“Did you get the job done?”<br><br>“We sure did,” said Joe.<br><br>"We need to know where you put it,” said the sheriff, “The dogs are having trouble finding it.”<br><br>“Do you know where we put it, Charlie? I don’t remember,” said Joe.<br><br>"I don’t either,” said Charlie, “We looked at so many places trying to guess where a bomber would hide it.”<br><br>“Yeah, the day we had the box I got three or four calls to remove unattended packages,” said Joe.<br><br>“You don’t remember? Whatcha mean you don’t remember? Have you looked anywhere you may have left it?” said the sheriff.<br><br>“I’ve looked where I thought it was; wanted to see if it was still there. I never found it; figured I forgot where it was, or maybe Joe moved it,” Charlie said.<br><br>“Why didn’t you write a note to remind yourself of where you put it?” said the sheriff.<br><br>“Didn’t think it was important. Knew the dogs would find it,” Said Charlie.<br><br>“Not important! You forgot where it is, and the dogs can’t find it. It’s a goddamned mess. For all I or anybody else knows it might have been mistaken for baggage and put on an airplane. It’s no telling where it is by now,” the sheriff said with disgust.<br><br>“Well, one good thing about it, there ‘s no detonator in the box to set it off,” said Joe with a grin.<br><br>“Thank God for little favors; maybe it could be worse,” said the sheriff.<br><br>So far as anyone, anywhere has heard, the whereabouts of the box of explosives is still unknown. Any information concerning the box should be given to your local police.<br><br>Footnote: This is a true story, I think. The names have been changed to protect the guilty.	1	2017-04-21 01:19:02.274897	2017-04-23 00:12:20.40126	2006	3	\N	\N	\N	702	\N	\N
39	Headin' Home	“I’ve got my stuff all packed, how about you?” I said, as I zipped up my bag, “We have a long way to go.”<br><br>“Just about, only a few things to pack,” she said, “I’ll be done in a couple of minutes. Load up the car and check out. I want to go down to the beach for a little while before we leave.”<br><br>“OK, but don’t be too long,” I said. It was Dorothy’s routine, before departing a resort, to have a last, long look, and possibly take a picture or two. It always took too long. I checked out and followed her to the beach, in the hope of urging her on.<br><br>“I had to see my noisy friends before we leave,” she said, as she tossed a handful of bread morsels into the air. Some of the gulls in her gang of scavengers circled overhead and snatched bits of bread as they flew. Others of the gang scurried after crumbs that fell to the ground, fighting over the bonanza, while screaming and squawking in the fray. Dorothy was delighted by the show, which continued until her sack of bread was exhausted. Feeding the birds was possibly her favorite thing at the beach. She would play with the gulls while I swam in the ocean, being occasionally swamped by a breaker.<br><br>We had been at a beach resort for a week. Our villa overlooked the beach at Tybee Island, Georgia, a little east of Savannah. From our balcony we could watch the sun creep up out of the morning clouds that hovered over the horizon as if trying to prolong the night. But the sun found a crack in the clouds, and sent through them brilliant beams, declaring victory over darkness. Our balcony provided a good vantage point for watching ships approaching and departing the port of Savannah upriver. Night was an especially intriguing time to watch the lights of ships. Some skimmed the ocean and disappeared at sea, while others languished on the horizon aboard ships waiting to enter the channel. Wonder where they were going, or where they were from?<br><br>The main attraction, of course, was the beach itself, where we had spent most time. We walked its length, padding along over the sand, and sometimes in the surf in bare feet. We were attracted by the sandpipers and other little birds scampering ahead of us. Dorothy loved to wade in the surf, so long as the water was no more than ankle deep. One day as we walked along the beach, I spotted a dark object.<br><br>“Look,” I said, “the high tide washed up a big horseshoe crab and dumped him on the beach.”<br><br>“He’s on his back and can’t move,” Dorothy said, as we watched for any sign of life, “I wonder if he’s still alive.”<br><br>“Let’s watch and see,” I said and slipped my foot under his side, turning him upright.<br><br>“He’s headed in the wrong direction,” she said, as we watched his agonizingly slow progress.<br><br>“He’s beginning to circle around. He’s headed toward the water,” I said, as a gallery of beach walkers assembled.<br><br>“He’s got a way to go, but I think he’ll make it,” said someone in the gallery, and so he did. As we all watched he triumphantly disappeared beneath the surf.<br><br>As we strolled back to our abode we watched a line of pelicans fly low looking for fish, and we marveled at the strange variety of God’s creatures.<br><br>Having said farewell to her bird friends, Dorothy walked with me to the car, and we headed for Ohio. We said goodbye as we drove through Savannah and onto the beautiful bridge crossing the river. From the bridge we saw close-up a freighter heading upstream toward port. Old buildings of commerce were visible on our right and newer commercial buildings on our left. We were on route US 17, a rural highway following the Atlantic coast. Our drive took us through the low country of South Carolina featuring farmland and woodland. In about an hour we came to the interstate highway with its monotonous scenery, trees on both sides. After awhile, as we were cruising along, a big passenger van loaded with men crept alongside and slowly passed. Things were calm for a moment, but then what I saw ahead caused my to do a double take.<br><br>“Do you see what I see?” I exclaimed.<br><br>“What?”<br><br>“Look at what came out of the window of that van. It’s the ugliest ass I ever saw. It’s big, fat, hairy, and obscene.”<br><br>“He’s lucky his whole body didn’t come out the window. Look, there’s his hand patting it. Have you ever been mooned before?” she said.<br><br>“No. First time. I wonder to what I owe this honor”<br><br>“Beats me,” she said, “Looks like a bunch of guys headed for a football game.<br><br>“Football game,” I mused, and checked my rear view mirror. “That’s it!” In the corner of my rear window I saw the sticker; a montage of a wildcat with “University of Kentucky” emblazoned across it.&nbsp;	1	2017-04-21 01:16:31.789668	2017-04-23 00:12:20.442611	2006	7	\N	\N	\N	907	\N	\N
44	Toy-Toy	My grandson, Shawn, as a lad of three who lived in Texas, loved big trucks and was fascinated by dinosaurs of every size and shape. He was a curious young lad, eager to learn almost everything. One day he found a seed in his food and wondered if it would be resurrected into a plant. He buried the embryonic mass in a grave prepared for it in a Dixie cup. With the help of his mom, he tended his garden, keeping it moist without drowning it. In a few days the husk of the seed appeared above the grave, as a flag on its staff. Soon the husk dropped off, revealing a pair of pale green lobes spread apart to gather life-sustaining light. It had become a plant. Its resurrection was complete.<br><br>The little plant put forth leaves and gained stature as days passed. As the visible part of the plant grew, so did its roots, and like a crawfish outgrowing his shell, soon needed more room to grow. The Dixie cup was discarded in favor of a bigger pot plus new soil. The plant was, by this time, obviously a tree. Shawn named it Toy-Toy. It is unclear how many new homes Toy-Toy had over the next two or three years, but it was enough to sustain life.<br><br>Toy-Toy’s family brought her along on their move from Texas to Louisiana. There, Toy-Toy continued to live in her private garden until her family moved into its own house. The fenced-in back yard, with trees and shrubs around the perimeter, made good cover for small wildlife, such as birds and squirrels. A pecan tree, much favored by the squirrels, who claimed it as their own, gripped tightly its feeding place in the yard. There was an area between the pecan tree and the fence big enough for another tree. It was much more space than needed for such a small fry as Toy-Toy, but she would need room to stretch her arms if she were to become a real tree. She was given that place in the sun to rule over, a place much more life-friendly than her portable garden.<br><br>She was on her own, and thrived in her realm. Now she is a genuine tree. She stands straight and tall, perhaps too tall. She is a lady adorned in her most splendid gown, verdant always and glistening in the sun. Her sweet perfume sometimes fills the air, but is never overwhelming. Her silence is sometimes broken with a murmur in a breeze. She is a highway for the squirrels, an aboveground shortcut to their cafeteria. She is a wildcat if molested, her ever sharpened claws ready to dig deep into an intruder.<br><br>Toy-Toy is not just a tree that produces seeds. She bears fruit, which she will reluctantly give up to one who is patient enough to gather it amongst her thorns.&nbsp;<br><br>Sometimes a squirrel strays from the highway and cuts fruit from a branch and lets it drop to the ground. We call him a vandal. All is not lost, however; one can pick up the squirrel’s debris and with a little elbow grease enjoy a delicious drink of orange juice.	1	2017-04-21 01:20:48.505255	2017-04-23 00:12:21.259307	2006	6	\N	\N	\N	545	\N	\N
40	Owl	“Are we there yet?” comes a voice from the back seat of the car. That must be the tenth time I’ve heard the question since we left home. Here we are in the rolling hills of southern Indiana, headed for a state park, where we mean to camp for a night or two.<br><br>“Just about,” I say, “I see a sign up ahead that says ‘Park’.” We turn on to the side road and follow it for two or three miles to the park entrance, where we’re greeted by a park ranger, looking for some money, I reckon.<br><br>“We’re lookin’ for a campsite,” I say and pay the fee.<br><br>“Just follow the signs,” says the ranger. We do so and drive into a very nice campground, where several tents are already set up. The campground is situated in a cove surrounded by forest on all sides. Trees are scattered throughout the campground, giving shade to many individual sites. We drive around accessing our prospects.<br><br>“This looks like a good spot,” says Mary, pointing out a site near the edge of the woods.<br><br>“Looks good to me, close to the water supply and not too far from the toilets,” I say.<br><br>“Look, there’s a place for a campfire,” says one of our girls who is still awake.<br><br>While Mary unpacks our food, I muscle out our canvas tent that weighs about forty pounds. I solicit help from the boys in setting up the tent. Now I can relax for a few minutes.<br><br>We put up the tent fly over the table, in case of rain or of careless birds overhead in a tree. We are about done with our camp setup. The children go exploring the campground, while Mary and I finish our campsite chores. We sit for a while listening to birds trill their late afternoon songs. The children come back from their exploration. We learn how many campsites tents occupy, and how many by camping trailers. We don’t find out the number of empty sites remaining. Since they are back it must be suppertime.<br><br>Everyone eats with a good appetite. We hear cicadas now singing in full voice. It is nearly deafening, especially when we try to talk. We finish supper and the children clean up the dishes. It’s nearly dark now, and time to start the campfire. It is not cold. It’s just that a campfire is one of the most pleasurable things about a campout.<br><br>“You kids get out the air mattresses and blow them up while I get the fire goin,” I say. I arrange some kindling in the fire ring and add wood atop. I cheat a little by using some paper as part of the kindling. I soon have the fire ablaze. The cicadas have quieted down with darkness at hand. Their song is replaced by the cricket-like sounds of nocturnal insects.<br><br>We gather around our fire in more or less a semicircle. We can see each other’s faces in the flickering light. Each face seems to take on different shapes as the light from the fire varies. It’s a warm night. Some of us must move back from the heat. As we watch, tongues lick upward from the wood as if trying to get a taste of sweet nectar just out of reach. Pale orange and yellow flames dance to a steady rhythm of their own. Their dance steps and colors vary as their fuel is consumed. A piece of wood drops toward the embers, releasing a shower of tiny scarlet fireworks shooting skyward. Our campfire is a thing of beauty. We sit quietly, nearly mesmerized, as the fire burns down to embers. We are all ready for sleep. I douse the fire and we all turn in.<br><br>The night has cooled the air. Six of us go into the tent and find our beds. I button the tent flaps, and soon we are all asleep. I am jarred awake.<br><br>“Who who, who-are-you. – Who who, who-are-you,” says a voice from high above.<br><br>“What was that?” Says one of the children in a voice that sounds fearful that a monster might be invading our tent.<br><br>“It’s only a hoot owl stopping by to greet us,” I say. I am intrigued. I’ve never heard a hoot owl so close before. After repeating his midnight greeting a few more times, he leaves and all is quiet again. I resume my sleep.<br><br>“Who who, who-are-you,” I am awakened again.&nbsp;<br><br>“I heard you the first time, Go away!” I grumble. After repeating himself a few times he does go away. I try to go back to sleep. I‘m not sure whether or not I go back to sleep before he’s back for an encore. By morning I lose track of the number of his visits.<br><br>Its daylight now and I struggle out of the tent, sleepy eyed. The others soon follow. They all look as if our night visitor has affected them as well. After a good breakfast everybody seems to be awake and ready for the day.<br><br>“Can we go down to the lake?” someone asks.<br><br>“Sure, we can, but not now. We’ll go after lunch,” I say. “There’s a nice trail through the woods that I think you will enjoy. Let’s hike it this morning. OK with everybody?”<br><br>“All right! Sounds like a good idea.”<br><br>After a little while we head out and find the trailhead half way around the campground to begin our walk. The trail winds around, and up and down through a hardwood forest of mostly maple, oak, and hickory. The grade is mostly gentle, with only a few steep places. I point out features of different trees; leaves, bark, and shape. We take note of the ground cover and see several varieties of fern. We notice wild flowers; trillium, jack-in-the-pulpit, columbine, and many others. As we walk, the wood is very quiet except for a bird song and an occasional gray squirrel foraging for his dinner.&nbsp;<br><br>We are enjoying our walk in the woods when the quiet is interrupted by the sound of a multitude of blue jays squawking up ahead. We soon emerge from the forest into a good-sized clearing. We look up to see a few dozen jays flying in more or less a circle at the edge of the clearing. They fly screaming up to the edge of the forest, turn and rejoin the circle of friends.<br><br>“Wonder what has them so excited,” say Mary, as we continue down the trail.<br><br>“It must be something near the edge of forest,” I say, as we draw near to where the birds turn away from the forest.<br><br>“Look, high in that tree,” one of the boys says, pointing excitedly. We all stop to look where he is pointing.<br><br>There on a limb of a tall tree, at the very edge of the woods is perched a big, sleepy looking bird. He has one eye half open, watching his tormenters as they fly by, right in his face. He seems to have an annoyed look about him. We stand and watch for a while, enjoying the show. No doubt that’s the same hoot owl that hooted at us all night.<br><br>“This surely serves him right,” we all agree.	1	2017-04-21 01:17:23.068087	2017-04-23 00:12:20.373122	2006	3	\N	\N	\N	1281	\N	\N
33	(W)	The summer term of 1943 at the University of Kentucky was almost over. It had been a tough term. Courses had been compressed so that course material had to be covered in half the normal time. My main course met at 7:00 am, for two hours daily. That was particularly hard for me because it was not my nature to get up early in those days. I managed to struggle through it with a passing grade and graduate, but I had to go back and learn what I had missed, later on in my career. It was customary for companies seeking new graduates to interview seniors shortly before their graduation. Interviewers came one day from Oak Ridge, representing the Manhattan Project. They offered good paying jobs and security. (Remember that this project produced the first atom bombs.)<br><br>“What will I be doing in the job,” I asked. They couldn’t answer my question. It was some big secret, I supposed. I took the application forms to mull over before I decided anything. I considered the offer, and discussed it with my friend and classmate, Birney Layson. The job would be close to home, the pay would be good, and my deferment would probably continue, but I was having a hard time coping with not knowing what I would be doing. While I was procrastinating, Birney filled out his forms and dropped them in a mailbox.<br><br>In class the next morning it was announced that representatives from Westinghouse were to conduct interviews after class. Birney and I both attended the interviews. We learned that new graduates would be hired as student engineers. New hires would be given assignments at several divisions of the company to give both student and management a chance to evaluate compatibility. This seemed a better deal to me, and to Birney, too.<br><br>“I already sent in my application,” said Birney, “let’s go see if I can get it back from the post office.”<br><br>Off we went, trying to catch up with his mail. We first stopped at the box where he deposited it. It had been picked up. On to the post office we went. Birney pleaded his case, and he was given forms to fill out, but it wasn’t there. We would have to wait for the truck that picked up from the box where it was dropped. We headed back to the Westinghouse guys and accepted jobs with the company.<br><br>Birney got his mail back from the post office so that he didn’t have to resign before he was hired. Before long we graduated without ceremony.<br><br>The next time I saw Birney we were in Pittsburgh, Pa. at the Westinghouse Educational Center, along with a group of new engineering graduates. We spent our first week there in orientation. We were given help in finding lodging. Birney needed a place for himself and his wife, Ruby. I chose board and room at Mr. and Mrs. Smith’s house in Wilkinsburg. During the week we learned about the company’s products and locations. Representatives from different divisions came in to tell us about their operations, and suggest assignments.&nbsp;<br><br>The Smiths had three of four young Westinghouse engineers living with them when I moved in for my six-month stay. They made a companionable and well-behaved group. We all met together for meals. Each of us had our own identifiable napkin ring and a clean napkin often enough. We had good meals, including Philadelphia scrapple now and then. We always knew that the meal was over when Mr. Smith asked, “Is this all we are to receive at this time?”<br><br>My first assignment was at East Pittsburgh, an old, dirty facility, used for making heavy equipment. Each morning I rode a streetcar to work, went to my desk and got out a dust rag to clean off the dirt and grime. Even so, my shirtsleeves were past tattle-tell gray by noon. My main occupation was testing industrial-size motors.<br><br>The early fall weather made it an ideal time to explore my environment. Downtown Pittsburgh was an interesting but most confusing place, with it triangular blocks nestled between the squares facing the rivers that angle in and join to form the Ohio. The city’s cultural center, with its museums, theaters and so on, surrounding Pittsburgh University was a pleasant place to visit and hang out for a while. An occasional visit to a park with the Laysons and another Kentucky grad, Ben Rector, was a welcome Sunday afternoon event.<br><br>My next assignment was entirely different from the first. It was at the Research Labs. I was exposed to work on developing rectifiers and electromechanical devices. The offices and laboratories were clean and the work atmosphere was somewhat relaxed. A room was set aside for that purpose during the lunch hour. There was even a corner where we could dance. I met several young women there that I wouldn’t have otherwise known. Laverne, a pretty, fair-skinned, brown-eyed young woman with blushing curls caught my eye. She was fun to be with, and appreciated my attention. She became high on my short list of potential mates. We corresponded for a while after I left, but time and distance took their inevitable toll.&nbsp;<br><br>After six months in Pittsburgh, I left for my last assignment in Lima, Ohio where I accepted a regular job, which I felt better matched my talents. In the meantime Birney had taken a job in Buffalo, New York. I think he never became acclimated to the Buffalo winters, because he eventually quit engineering and moved to Florida to run a marina. I have often wondered how different my life would have been had I taken the job at Oak Ridge.	1	2017-04-21 00:58:21.152823	2017-04-23 00:12:21.266658	2005	2	\N	\N	\N	980	\N	\N
34	(W) 2	The people in Industrial Relations at Westinghouse gave me the usual policy blurb for new hires, no doubt as a reminder, for I had heard the blurb on my first trip here. They were very good in helping a young single guy to find a place to live. Getting off the Elm Street bus I found the address given me. It was a fine looking old brick house with a full front porch, a much better place than I had ever lived. A kind grandmotherly-looking lady greeted me at the door.<br><br>“Good morning, my name is Don Jessee,” I said, “The people at Westinghouse said you might have a room for rent. I’m a new engineer with Westinghouse.”<br><br>“Yes indeed,” she said, “Since Mr. Becker, my husband, died I have rented my upstairs rooms to young men. I have two from Westinghouse. One young man just left to get married. I’ll show you the room he had.”<br><br>I thanked Mrs. Becker and took the room. It served my purpose very well. The only drawback was that I had to eat out. That was no big deal except on Sundays. The few open restaurants were a mile away, down town. The busses didn’t run and I had no car. After a few long walks I soon learned to keep some snack food on hand.<br><br>My new boss was B. O. Austin, Section Engineer of the Control section, a group of engineers in charge of developing schemes and hardware for control and protection of electric power systems for airplanes. This included assuring the proper output voltage of the electric generator and protecting the system from being damaged by overloads, short circuits, etc.<br><br>B.O., as he preferred to be called, was a fatherly figure about the age of my father. B.O. was an even-tempered, soft-spoken man from North Carolina. (I never saw him show anger.) He was always on the lookout for innovative ways for doing things. He took a dim view of the “moss backs” who thought, “This is how we always did it.” As a result, B.O. had a lot of patents. It was because of his early influence that I eventually got 27 patents myself.&nbsp;<br><br>In those days transistors were unheard of. A computer was as big as a house. Electronic circuits used vacuum tubes, which were fragile, bulky and produced a lot of heat. Thus, it should be no surprise that virtually all control and protective devices made use of electromagnets. Voltage regulators and switching devices suitable for the environment in an airplane were not commercially available, and had to be made in-house. B.O. obtained several copies of a book about the design of magnets. He handed me a copy and declared me an expert in magnetic design. Before he retired B.O. elected me expert in many other things that I knew absolutely nothing about. We had a sample department where craftsmen built newly designed apparatus. B.O.’s philosophy was to make a few calculations and then go build a model and test it. As a junior engineer I assisted Don Exner and O.C. Walley in refining the designs of their projects.<br><br>Meanwhile, I continued to live at Mrs. Becker’s house and ride the bus to work and elsewhere or walk. After a few months Mrs. Becker decided to sell the house. I wondered where I would move to, but an odd thing happened. The tenants went with the house. Mrs. Becker moved out, the Filsons moved in and we tenants stayed put. I had never been sold before, but it worked our all right. Our new landlords proved to be amiable people and we became friends. Their young son, David, enjoyed having big boys in the house to talk to and joke around with. He seemed to have sympathy for me when I used an expression I’d picked up in the army, “Oh, my achin’ back!” implying surprise or dismay.<br><br>A member of the section, known as Mac McMaster, had a 10-year old Dodge sedan that I coveted. Cars of that vintage had a fabric rooftop. The roof of Mac's car had rotted away and was replaced by a sheet steel roof held in place by many screws, about an inch apart. New cars were virtually unavailable during the war and Mac was reluctant to sell. Once the war was over he decided to quit his job and move on. He sold me his car, for which I was really glad, for now I didn’t need to rely on bus schedules. I could pursue a lifestyle more suitable to a young man.<br><br>I continued living with the Filsons for more than a year, until I was overcome by matrimony. After the wedding David’s mother, Ploma, relayed to me his comment during the ceremony, “I’ll bet he said, ‘Oh, my achin’ back’. ”	1	2017-04-21 01:00:26.704307	2017-04-23 00:12:21.273116	2005	2	\N	\N	\N	838	\N	\N
62	To my children	Before the Great Depression nearly all my aunts and uncles lived within a morning buggy ride of all their siblings. My dad and Uncle Billy lived farther from their kin than the others. Living close together made it easy and natural to keep in touch. Uncle Billy and Dad moved away from the others; nevertheless Dad made frequent trips to visit as many of his siblings as possible. Personal contact between siblings was a good and satisfying thing for them.<br><br>I believe that you, my children, all love each other and sometimes wish you lived only a short buggy ride from each other, but this is not the case. Getting together takes real effort and is not always possible. Think back to when your late stepmother Dorothy was with us. She loved all of you and understood how important it was to get together as a family. That wasn’t easy. There was always a conflict in somebody’s schedule. It was a wonder that we got together at all, but we did and we were all the better for it. I give Dorothy all the credit.<br><br>I sincerely hope that you will continue to be a close-knit family. I regret that my siblings and I could not have been as close as you are. It was not until near the end of my brother’s life that we began to know each other. At least you have the advantage of being well acquainted.<br><br>Telephones provide a great way to stay in touch, but there is no substitute for face-to-face contact. Try to remember some of the things you did together on previous reunions. You explored the place and reported the new things you found. You played games that you had played with your neighbors but found them more exciting when you beat your brother. You cooked meals together that tasted better than those cooked at home. You all talked together and learned many things that you couldn’t learn over the phone. In short, you enjoyed the company. Remember your hikes just to see waterfalls, and a special retirement party for your dad?<br><br>For a reunion to happen you must put it near the top of your list of priorities. I believe the best way to start is to plan for the next year. First agree on a time when you all can possibly get together and then decide where to meet. It may not work, but it has a good chance. One of you should be in charge. You ought to take turns at leadership so that no one is burdened.<br><br>Don’t forget to include your children and grandchildren in your plan. It’s a very good thing for cousins to know each other. Good luck and may you have many happy reunions in the future.<br><br><br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:05:43.991043	2017-04-23 00:12:20.380094	2007	7	\N	\N	\N	483	\N	\N
81	Dinah (my version)	Upon arriving home one evening I noticed a cardboard box on the floor, near the kitchen door.<br><br>“What’s this?” I inquired of Mardelle, my second wife. I answered my own question by looking inside the box. It was a very small, black pup, no longer than four or five inches, not counting its tail. Nevertheless, its length seemed excessive compared to its girth. The poor little thing was laid out on a heating pad that was warm, but shivering of the pup was evident with only a casual look.<br><br>“I brought it home from the animal shelter,” Mardelle explained. “Someone found four pups in a shoebox in a front yard near the shelter. Three of the pups were dead, having spent a cold night outdoors in the box. This one survived because of their warmth. I promised the Humane Society that I would help by feeding and caring for young animals that hadn’t been weaned. So here it is.”<br><br>In the days that followed, Mardelle fed the little critter with a small nippled bottle provided by the shelter. Despite the heating pad the shivering continued. I would pick up the pup and hold it in my hand, against my warm belly while I read the evening paper and Mardelle fixed supper. I continued this practice for several days until the shivering stopped. By then it must have become a habit, for I continued as if I enjoyed it.<br><br>After about three weeks Mardelle took the dog to a vet for an examination. Our care had helped restore its health. The vet had clients who had recently lost a dog, and suggested ours for them. Before the transaction was completed, I realized that even though Mardelle had been the one to feed her, the pup thought that I was her mother. How could I desert her now? She had become my dog.<br><br>“You know, I kind of like this little dog,” I said.<br><br>“Well, I guess I’ll just have to call the vet and tell her that the folks will just have to wait for another one,” Said Mardelle.<br><br>“What should we name her?” I asked.<br><br>“I kind if like Dinah,” Mardelle said, “But it sounds too much like the name of a Negro kitchen maid.”<br><br>“So much the better,” I said. “It’s a good name and fits the dog perfectly, I’m not afraid of the politically correct. Her name is Dinah.” And so it was that I became a dog owner for the first time in many years.<br><br>As Dinah grew, she looked long, her legs were short and she had a long narrow muzzle. She had long wavy black hair and finally grew to about a foot high at the shoulder. She may have been partly wienie dog, but her pedigree remained unknown. She became a great pet, a watchdog, and even a hunter.<br><br>There lived in the neighborhood a big collie that took a walk every day, passing our house in both directions. If Dinah were in the front yard when the collie passed, she would defend her territory by chasing him to the opposite side of the road. Eventually the collie just walked on that side of the road without being prompted. Dinah didn’t know that she couldn’t back up her bluster with her brawn until she encountered an ill-tempered German shepherd. The shepherd had attacked and killed two cats in the neighborhood. The unfortunate encounter came when I was trimming shrubs near the house and Dinah was sniffing around nearby. Dinah saw the shepherd at some distance and barked her territorial warning. The shepherd ignored the warning and ran toward us and attacked Dinah. I was able to drive him off before he did real damage to her. The shepherd’s owner saw the incident and came to apologize and see if my dog was hurt. Dinah had only a superficial wound. Perhaps more cautious, she still protected her territory. Not long after that, the German shepherd was no more seen in the neighborhood.&nbsp;<br><br>Once a mole invaded our back yard starting at our neighbor’s yard and boring across to the other side. There seemed to be no exit to the other neighbor’s yard. I started to eliminate the mole by crushing the mole hole under foot, walking on it, starting at one end, toward the middle, then repeating the procedure from the other end. The next day I found a new ridge, much shorter near the middle of the yard. I summoned Dinah to help. I showed her the wound in the lawn. She sniffed around for a few minutes and we found the general area of the mole’s location. She started digging and very soon pulled the mole out of his hole. She shook him with vengeance for the next couple minutes before she dropped him. He didn’t move after that. He was a big varmint, with huge claws for digging his way under the sod. He was the first and last of moles to visit my yard.<br><br>Dinah’s bravery was not unbounded. When she heard thunder she would hide under a bed or the nearest handy refuge. In her later years, when I would return home after a night or two away, she would follow me around for days as a duckling follows its mother. Maybe she feared being abandoned again as she was at her beginning.<br><br>Dinah was my little friend all her life. She always met me at the door when I came home and looked very happy about it. That made me feel really glad that we had helped save her from the jaws of an early death.	1	2017-04-22 16:32:45.504646	2017-04-23 00:12:21.280066	2005	4	black_pup.jpg	\N	\N	979	\N	\N
38	First Home	Several temporary shacks sat side by side in rows on either side of a street formed to accommodate them. Well, they were not shacks exactly, but would soon be for lack of maintenance. They had been built to house workers during WWII. After the war rental places were hard to find, and Mary, my resourceful bride, had asked around, found this place and rented a unit for us. It provided shelter and privacy. What else does a newly wed couple need?<br><br>We had a bed, a table, some chairs, two kerosene stoves, one for cooking and one for heating the place. Heating, that became a problem with winter coming on. The walls were very thin, with no insulation. I needed to bring a can of kerosene often for heat and cooking. There was no point in thinking about decorating. Mary worked at Hart Jewelers, so nobody was there during the day, and we were planning to move as soon as we found a suitable place to rent.<br><br>Again, it was Mary to the rescue. She learned that her cousin, Olive Early, and her husband, Cal, had houses around town that they rented. Early was a well-known name around the county. Cal’s father was Deed Early who left his print around the county with lightning rods. One would see a farmhouse with a rod at each end and say “old Deed’s been here”. I guess Cal took after his dad, only in rental houses. Fortunately, Cal had a vacancy at the time we needed it. It was in town on Albert Street.&nbsp;<br><br>Albert St. was in the old, mature part of town. Many of the early residents worked at Lima Locomotive Works close by. Its huge, powerful steam engines pulled both passenger trains and freight cars loaded with coal or other stuff in all parts of the country. Most of Mary’s classmates had lived in this area of town, so she felt quite at home there. The house was a two story, family-sized frame house that had been partitioned into two apartments. A young couple, Woody and Juanita Frizzell, occupied the upstairs. Mary and I upgraded our abode to the downstairs apartment.<br><br>We lived here for the next five years. What happened here was mostly mundane and forgettable, but some events were memorable. Come to think of it, some of my life’s most important events took place here. For more than a year, we were merely newlyweds. Then we became a family. I had convinced Mary to give up her jewelry store job and become a homemaker. This proved to be a wise decision, for during this time our family grew to include four children, one of whom was yet unborn.<br><br>I suppose things were pretty much normal for a young couple with a very young family. I remember naked young bodies being bathed in the kitchen sink by their mom. I still see chocolate birthday cake covering the face of a three year old. Most of all I recall being awakened in the middle of the night by the cries of a baby, a call to the doctor, and the following hour. The baby, Catherine, had a fever of 105 degrees. Putting the child on the kitchen table, and following the doctor’s direction, we soaked towels in cold tap water and applied them to the hot baby. It seemed so cruel, and I was shivering before we were done, but it brought down her fever to a livable state. In a few days she was as good as new.<br><br>Against my better judgment I joined a bunch of young bucks at work to form a softball team. I’d never played before, so I didn’t know much about the game. I learned two things pretty soon. I wasn’t good at catching the ball, but I was very good at striking out. I thought maybe I’d get better, so I persisted. During one game, my attempt to catch the ball resulted in a stove up finger. The finger swelled some before the game was over. That night I realized the finger had a ring on it and had swollen so that the ring wouldn’t slip off, even with soap. I was awakened in the middle of the night, this time by the painful throbbing in my left hand. Nothing was left to do but to rummage through my toolbox and find a file to remove the ring. I played the rest of the season with a sore finger, but never again with a ring on it. As I recall I usually rejoiced when a game was called off because of rain.<br><br>We became good friends of our upstairs neighbors, and with a young couple across the street, Jim and Betty Cusick. They too, were busy starting families. Their children were near the ages of ours and played together amiably.<br><br>One day Woody came home smiling from ear to ear. He had a new product to offer his customers. Pillsbury was introducing brown and serve rolls. Woody was so elated that he seemed to walk on air for the next week. A baker at Pillsbury likely had accidentally taken a batch of rolls out of the oven too soon. Voila, a new product!<br><br>Even as a renter, I got a few free lessons in what it meant to be a householder.&nbsp;<br><br>“These dingy walls could use a coat of paint,” Mary said one day.<br><br>“I’ll talk to Cal about it,” I said. And I did.<br><br>“I won’t paint it for you,” Cal said “but I’ll be glad to buy some paint. Paint’s cheap, it’s the labor that costs,” Cal never had a reputation of spending money. Guess who painted the room.<br><br>I left the house one night while Mary entertained a group of her high school friends. Home is no place for a husband in such a situation. Later, hoping I hadn’t worn out my welcome at a friend’s house, I headed home in the rain. Upon my arrival, I learned that the toilet was plugged up. Thoroughly! After the usual methods failed to unplug it, I took on the laborious task of disassembling the whole thing, and taking the bowl outside. I felt really foolish, sitting out in the rain at midnight, picking crap out of a toilet bowl. With the aid of a long screwdriver and a garden hose, I got it unplugged long after my bedtime. Before I could go to bed I had to put the bathroom back in shape and clean up.<br><br>“Honey,” I said to Mary, “Next time remind your friends to go to the bathroom before they come.”<br><br>The house was half a block from the railroad. Trains went by slowly with only short blasts of the whistle several blocks away. One steam engine, however, made a peculiar noise and passed late at night. The noise was, no doubt, made by steam discharged from valves or cylinders. No matter the source, it sounded like its wheels squeaked; we dubbed it Squeaky Wheels. Many a night our slumber was disturbed by old Squeaky Wheels. We usually went back to sleep. Other times, we were somewhat rested, and passion trumped sleep for a time.<br><br>Eventually the pitter-patter of three pairs of little feet made it evident that it was time to start looking for a bigger place to live. We would miss our neighbors and homey atmosphere, but new neighbors could be good and we could make a new place homey.&nbsp;<br><br>I have often wondered how many of our children began their lives because of old Squeaky Wheels.	1	2017-04-21 01:15:29.402379	2017-04-23 00:12:20.408202	2006	3	\N	\N	\N	1314	\N	\N
35	Calaban	The cat gave me more attention than I solicited. I just sat and visited, otherwise minding my own business. The cat evidently wanted to visit too. He caressed my feet and legs with his chin. He walked away and then came back for an encore. He stood where I could easily stroke him, and I obliged with a rub and a pat. He showed no inclination to go away.<br><br>“I believe your cat likes me,” I said.<br><br>“He’s not my cat,” said Glenna, “He belongs to a friend of mine who’s allergic to cats. I’m keeping the cat for him until he finds him a new home.”<br><br>“Seein’ as how we get along so well, I might be able to provide him a home. I think we could become buddies,” I said.<br><br>"I’ll talk to my friend and see what he says,” replied Glenna.<br><br>My wife Mardelle and I were on a little trip, and had stopped off at her daughter Glenna’s place on our way. On our way back Glenna said that she had talked to her friend.<br><br>"He said that you could have the cat, but he asked that you shouldn’t change his name,” she said.<br><br>The name was Calaban. He was a pure bred Siamese cat, of the old standard variety, rather than one of the skinny, sharp nosed, new models. His owner didn’t pass on his papers, which made no difference, since he was to be just a pet.<br><br>I had never liked cats much, but I loved birds. I didn’t like the way cats sneaked up on baby birds that could barely fly a few feet. Now I found myself a cat owner; correction, caretaker. Nobody really owns a cat. It’s more likely; it’s the other way around. Mardelle had a Burmese cat named Nedra that lived with us, and I liked her all right. Like Nedra, Calaban would be an indoor cat, and couldn’t harm the birds.<br><br>Calaban had a sociable personality. He got along with Nedra as well as he got along with people. He entered a room of people and chose one to give his attention, sometimes jumping into her lap. It was always the one who least liked cats.&nbsp;<br><br>Like all cats, Calaban liked to stretch his claws. Being an indoor cat, Calaban preferred the furniture to his scratching post. There was no other choice than to have him declawed. We had him neutered as well, to discourage spraying. A month later a woman who had a female Siamese cat, looked for a mate for her cat. Alas, she spoke too late. We felt bad about it. He would have sired beautiful kittens.<br><br>Calaban was tolerant. He would lie on the floor on his side and let someone push him around, even under the couch, and then come back for more. He liked to play trapeze, being swung between my legs.<br><br>Sometimes Mardelle let the cats out for a short time. On one such occasion, Calaban encountered our neighbor’s cat. A fight ensued. Although Calaban was holding his own, I thought it an unfair fight since the neighbor’s cat had a full set of claws. I broke up the fight with my shovel and chased the intruder home. Another time Nedra was attacked by the same cat and received a gash in her belly. With much ire, Mardelle informed the neighbor. Late that night I heard the neighbor’s car leave. I never saw their cat again. I often wondered where he dumped the cat.<br><br>On her outings Nedra would frequently cross the road into a field to hunt mice. Calaban, no hunter, and not too bright, followed her sometimes. One day, having followed, he turned to come back. A car approached. The driver saw him and slowed to a stop. Meanwhile Calaban saw the car, turned and ran back under it. The cat was injured in his back. The driver, a decent man, helped Mardelle lay him on a piece of plywood and get him to the vet. Home from the vet, Calaban was a sorry sight. His hind legs didn’t work, and to get around he dragged himself by pulling with his forefeet. We made him a bed near a wall where he spent the next month. Nedra had no sympathy for him. When she passed through the room where he lay she walked along the opposite wall. She was no Samaritan but a priest. She wouldn’t associate with him until he could walk again.<br><br>When Nedra, with a head start of four or five lives over Calaban, died, he began to grieve. His appetite sagged and his coat frayed a bit. We found a four-month-old feral kitten at the Humane Society, and brought her home for Calaban to train. She was half Siamese, half alley cat. She was a beautiful, blonde kitten with typical Siamese markings. As she grew, her coat darkened and her body took the shape of an alley cat. Calaban trained her pretty well, but she was skittish of strangers for many years hence.<br><br>We named her Madeline. Before we had her spayed she came into heat and raised a ruckus for a few days. Calaban tried to do what he could for her. He had lost his ability, but certainly not the idea. After she was spayed, the two got along like buddies. Calaban became a smooth operator. He licked her ears just enough to give her the idea to reciprocate. He then laid back and enjoyed his luxurious grooming.<br><br>Calaban had a pal for the remainder of his 21 years. Without Calaban, Madeline mellowed into a lap cat—almost.	1	2017-04-21 01:13:15.293942	2017-04-23 00:12:20.418002	2006	4	\N	\N	\N	984	\N	\N
36	Chatterbox	On a bright, sunny day in late spring I happened to look out the window to my back yard, where I saw a wren. He was perched on a lower branch of a nearby tree, singing his heart out. He sat there for a little while, and then he was gone. As always, I was glad to have seen him. I had put up a bird feeder near the tree to attract birds during the winter, and into the spring. I had also put a small birdhouse that would be suitable for wrens, in the crotch of the tree. The birdhouse was still unoccupied, and I had no hope of its being used, as I thought it was late in the season for nesting.<br><br>Later on that day I heard the intriguing sound of the wren once more, and went back to the window to watch. His chatterbox song stopped. He left the branch where he had been singing. He did not fly away, but dropped to the ground nearby, and looked around. He picked up a dried blade if grass, then another and yet another. To my surprise and delight he took them to the birdhouse and went inside. A moment later he emerged and flew back to his favorite branch and began his chatterbox song all over again. He repeated the song a few times before he once again dropped to the ground for more grass and tiny twigs. It was indeed fascinating to watch him. I could have watched for hours, but I had other things to do. Nevertheless, I know he continued his mission, for I could hear his song. When his song stopped after a while, I figured he had knocked off for the day. After all, a guy has to eat to keep up his strength.<br><br>The next day my little friend was back at his task, gathering his building materials and stopping after each load to do a lot of bragging about it. I thought that here was an individual who was extremely happy in his work. Wouldn’t it be nice if everybody could be like him? Despite this apparent enjoyment of his work he soon left the building site. A few hours later he was back at work, stopping to brag about his accomplishments as loudly as ever.<br><br>All this made me wonder about this whole drill. Where was his mate? I thought birds cooperated in building their nest. If not, was she just hanging out somewhere, just watching to see that he did the job right? If that were the case wouldn’t she come in to inspect it now and then? No. The truth had to be that he had no mate; that he was indeed a bachelor wren. He must be singing his chatterbox song to try to lure a pretty female wren to claim a new home. And what of his periodic times away? Was he singing his “come, look what I have” in other likely places? Perhaps he was building a nest in a second location. Don’t realtors stress location as a prime requisite? He could have been working on more than one other.<br><br>The chatterbox wren continued his gathering and singing for a week before he finally gave up. Or did he? He wouldn’t show up if he’d found success at another site. The answer to my question remains a mystery to this day, and always shall. Nevertheless, a bird that demonstrated so much ambition would not be a bachelor all his life. An early start the next year, perhaps?	1	2017-04-21 01:14:12.602333	2017-04-23 00:12:20.435854	2006	5	\N	\N	\N	606	\N	\N
82	Call Me	A few months after Mardelle and I were divorced, I was busy one Saturday afternoon with my weekend home chores when my doorbell rang. I answered the ring and to my utter surprise a friendly acquaintance stood there in the person of Dorothy Phillips.<br><br>Dorothy was a long time acquaintance. Even when Mary and I went to Encore Theatre, Dorothy was often the usher who showed us to our seats. After Mary’s death and I married Mardelle, Dorothy was frequently our usher at the shows.<br><br>More recently, Mardelle was a Humane Society enthusiast and she and I worked at their bingo games to raise operating funds. Dorothy sometimes helped at the bingo games. She was a good worker and a friendly person, although she sometimes she seemed a little flaky. She liked to talk and could talk to a perfect stranger with no problem at all.<br><br>I worked the bingo games after Mardelle had left me just to keep in touch with people.. One night toward the end of the bingo games Dorothy tried to ger a group of workers to agree to a get-together after the games at a bar and grill. Dorothy Bales and I heard the word ahd took up the challenge. Ms. Bales and I took a booth to wait for Ms. Phillips. We ordered some food and drink, and by the time we finished, Dorothy was still a no-show. We’d had our own private party and decided there had been miscommunication, and bid each other good night.<br><br>“Hello Dorothy,” I said to the acquaintance at my door, “Come on in and sit down. What brings you way out here to my neck of the woods?”<br><br>“I came to see you,” she said, “I could have called, but I wanted to get out of the house anyway. How have you been?”<br><br>“I’ve been getting along OK. Keep myself busy most of the time,” I said.<br><br>“I didn’t know uhtil recently that you and Mardelle divorced”<br><br>“Well I haveh’t broudcast the news. I guess she was tired of me. She waid she didn’t want to be married any more.”<br><br>“I’m sorry,” she said, “You seemed to be a good husband. You seemed to be good with Mardelle too,. I remember ushering you to your seats at Encore Theater.”<br><br>“Mardelle and Mary were very different,” I said, “Mary was much easier for me to please.”<br><br>We talked about barious things for the next half hour, about work, play, food, likes and dislikes. Finally when it seemed that she was ready to leave.<br><br>“I drove past your house twice beford I had the nerve to stop in. the real reasonk I came over,” she said, “was to invite you out to dinner. I won dinner for two at an Italian restaurant, and I wanted to share it with you.”<br><br>“Thank you, I’d be honored to accept,” I said and we made arrangements on the spot. She took a card out of her purse and wrote an address and a phone number on it and handed it to me as she left.<br><br>The day we were to have dinner together I checked the card she had given to me for her address. Dorothy was ready for our dinner date. she introduced me to her mother, Goldie Criedr. After a brief chat we left for dinners of fine Italian cuisine. Dorothy told me of her years as am e,[;puee pf West Ohio Gas Co. and of the shakeu[ in management that had changed her job from pleasant to disagreeable. She resigned her job and moved in with her mother while she looked for a new job. Though Dorothy had lived in Ohio all her life she was a southerner at heart. She went to Savannah in her quwst for a job, but without success, so she came back home and took a job with Green Thumb, an on-the-job training organization for unemployed people.<br><br>We spent a pleasant evening, talking about many other subjects. Before we said goodnight she invited me to call her. I said that I would be more than happy to do that. I had begun to kind of like her flaky style.<br><br>In a week or two I pulled out the card Dorothy had given me and dialed the number she had written. Mo answer. A few days later I tried again. No answer. I tried a few more times without success. Finally I drove over to her house and rang the doorbell. Dorothy came to the door.<br><br>“Hi Don. Glad you got here when you did. I was just about to go out. Why didn’t you call?”<br><br>“Why didn’t I call? I did. I did. And I did,” I said and handed her the card, the one that she had written on.<br><br>“Oh, no!” she screeched, “That’s the phone number at the apartment that I moved out of months ago. Come in!”	1	2017-04-22 16:34:13.140587	2017-04-23 00:12:21.286786	2011	5	\N	\N	\N	865	\N	\N
45	Beach	“I’d be glad for you to use it,” I told David. “Get a group of your friends to go with you. If you don’t use it the time will go to waste.”<br><br>“Ok,” he said, ‘Thanks a lot.”&nbsp;<br><br>We were talking about a time-share villa on the beach at Tybee Island, Georgia. I bought the time-share years ago for my late wife, Dorothy. She loved the place. We visited the resort every year. Some time later David called and said that he could not find friends interested; wouldn’t I come with my Louisiana family. So here we are – Catherine, Ghulam, and niece, Amara. When Shawn found that David’s daughter, Ursula, would come, he decided to drive here. He left home before the rest of us did and met us at the Savannah airport. I’ve always said, “If you have time to spare go by air.” David who drove here from Northern Virginia also met us at the airport. With two cars available we all arrived at the resort, ready to vacation.&nbsp;<br><br>We had a snack of seafood at an outdoor eatery, accompanied by a songster singing popular oldies, most new to me, and much chatter from the diners. We went on to the resort where David had laid in food from the local IGA, and settled into our quarters. Not much has changed on the beach since I was last here. The ocean tides still roll in and out. Visitors still roam the parking lot, head for the pavilion and the pier, some with fishing gear. Others walk on the hard sand of the beach, while some lie in the sun and occasionally play in the surf. Good eyes can still see ships lying in a row on the horizon, waiting a turn to ply up the river to port. Elsewhere around town, new structures have appeared, replacing vacant lots or old buildings. Inside, things are a lot different from the last time I was here with Dorothy. While then it was quiet, we now have the frequent rings of cell phones. If there are no incoming calls, there is soon one going out. The younger generations seem to be addicted. I remember when leisure meant slowing down one’s pace. Between phone calls, we all found time to enjoy the beach. Ursula and her dad made time to run, to sun, and to play in the water daily. We enjoyed standing on the pier, over the frothy surf, watching the breakers do their swirling dance up and down the beach. A trip to Savannah was, of course, a given; as it was for Dorothy and me. The main attraction was the old section where antebellum houses of the wealthy line the streets. They sit on streets interrupted every few blocks by squares where there are trees, statues, and occasionally benches. One can stop and just relax and enjoy the scene. We visited Dorothy’s second favorite spot, River Street, barely above sea level. It runs along the river, where a riverside pedestrian walk, with trees and benches, is located. The other side of the street houses a row of small shops, selling all kinds of things, most of which are useless except to visitors. Dorothy found a dress shop, run by an Indian who reminded her of Ghulam. She made a point to visit his shop every time we were in town.<br><br>All the hype on TV during our first couple of days at Tybee Island concerned 9/11/01, five years ago. On that day, Dorothy and I were here for our last time. I had turned on the TV to check the weather. Rather than a weather report, we saw pictures of a tall building belching smoke from a floor near the top. Our first reaction was one of unbelief and amazement. The voiceover said that it had been hit by an airplane. As we watched, a second building also emitted a cloud of smoke. Two airplanes, two buildings; this could be no accident. Terrorists! My amazement quickly turned to anger. I still harbor that anger. There was nothing we could do besides watch in horror as people jumped to avoid being burned to death. Our last week here turned out to be our worst. Besides the horrible event, Dorothy suffered cancer. We had hoped to be able to forget that for a little while, but no such luck.<br><br>The family remembered that I was having another birthday at midweek. They favored me with a rib eye steak, cooked on the outdoor grill. I’ve never tasted a better steak from the grill.<br><br>Catherine and Ghulam left us for a trip to Denver to buy stock for their store. That left a bed empty so that Shawn no longer had to sleep on the floor.<br><br>Shawn got a cell phone call in response to a resume he submitted to a potential employer. &nbsp; ”I’m on vacation with my family, and we’re are about to have lunch. May I call you back?” he responded. After lunch he returned the call, and had an hour interview on the phone.<br><br>“How do I get to Charleston? Time is of the essence,” he said and was soon off to a face-to-face interview. When he returned after a few hours, he was elated. He exuded confidence as he reported that he was to have a second interview with the regional manager. He spent his last day of vacation traveling to Jacksonville for that. Shawn missed out on some beach time, but it will be worth it if he gets the job. We are all rooting for him.<br><br>Yesterday I was up at sunrise. Facing east I saw despite my impaired vision a uniquely beautiful sky. The sun had risen above the horizon but it was hidden behind a cloud that formed a great blanket of color that painted the whole scene in a golden glow.<br><br>It has been a most unusual week. Tomorrow we head back home to Louisiana and more normal living. I’m now convinced that cell phones are good for some things. Good luck, Shawn!	1	2017-04-21 01:21:28.71628	2017-04-23 00:12:21.293442	2006	8	\N	\N	Non-Fiction	1045	Late	\N
77	Help from a Master	My company produced electric power systems using converters that made alternating current from a direct current source: this by switching the output terminals to the source in a unique way. We had built a few different models all having the same deficiency; the load affected the quality of the output.<br><br>My job was to develop an elegant control scheme to prevent degradation of the output quality. I had completed the conceptual analysis of the control scheme and built a prototype for testing it.<br><br>We subjected our converter to a wide variety of operating conditions, including no-load to full-load and over-loads. For the most part the performance was as predicted by my analysis, but we found an anomaly that we couldn’t explain. When certain loads were switched on or off the control system lost control momentarily. Control was regained but not until it had caused a corruption in the quality of the output power. We worked for a few days trying to isolate the cause of the problem without success. It had to be something simple, but what? The problem bothered me even at night.<br><br>I finally decided to not worry about it after working hours, and just relax. After supper I decided to relax to the music of Mozart. What better way was there than to rear back and listen to the sublime music of Mozart? I selected a piano concerto and listened as the extraordinary melodies emerged. I soon forgot the frustration of the last few days. I had heard that Mozart’s music benefited even unborn babies. I too felt the benefit. I felt totally at one with the music. The concerto finished and I started another.<br><br>I don’t recall how long I listened before a strange feeling entered my gut. I was back at work with my problem, but the tension was all gone. I knew what caused the anomaly. The tight control I had imposed on the system was too rigid. I would need to limit the correction effort of the control to allow a small error and prevent a large one. I continued listening to the music for the rest of the evening.<br><br>The next day I made a sight modification in my circuit, tested the system and all went well for all operating conditions. Thank you Mozart. I’m reminded that this concept applied in rearing children. One must allow little mistakes in hopes of preventing big ones later on.<br><br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:31:40.587153	2017-04-23 00:12:21.404575	2008	4	\N	\N	\N	421	\N	\N
50	Bill's Hobby	We were great friends in junior high school. Bill and I frequently hung around together after school. We did what adolescent boys usually do. We talked about all kinds of mysterious things, such as stars, machines and girls.<br><br>Bill was a mild mannered guy and kind of shy around girls (and so was I). His dad ran a garage and so had all kinds of mechanical things at his disposal. Bill’s dad or maybe his brother built a little car for him before I knew him. It had all the essentials of a self-propelled vehicle, just right for sidewalk travel. It had four wheels, a real steering wheel, a seat, and a motor powered by a car battery. It looked pretty neat to me. I was a little envious. Ever since I was big enough to read pictures in the Christmas edition of the Sears Roebuck catalog I had wished for a red truck to ride in, even though I’d have to pedal it to make it go.<br><br>Lately Bill had found a new hobby. The Louisville Courier Journal printed all the horseracing results from around the country. The paper was distributed throughout Kentucky and elsewhere. Bill had access to the paper and began following the races. I recon he learned the names and records of most of the horses and jockeys in the racing circuit. Soon racing became his favorite subject of conversation. No matter what we talked about, the conversation would include some report from the racing world.<br><br>“Sometimes I help my daddy work his garden, hoeing weeds and stuff like that. He raised some pole beans and I was amazed at how long the were,” I said one day when we were talking about vegetables we liked to eat.<br><br>“I like String Bean in the third race at Pimlico tomorrow,” he replied, “He’s a long shot but he could win. His odds are so good I’m picking him to place.”<br><br>A couple of days later I saw Bill and he was delighted to tell me, “String Bean came through for me. He didn’t win but he was in the money. He placed only half a length behind the winner; paid $16 to place.”<br><br>“Now how does that work? He didn’t win but he paid off,” I asked and he was more than happy to teach me.<br><br>“The winner pays all bets on him whether to win, place or show. If you bet on the second place horse to win, you lose, but if you bet on him to place you win. If you bet on him to show you win, only less than had you had bet on him to place. Understand?”<br><br>“I believe I do. The third place horse pays only if you bet on him to show.”<br><br>“I don’t usually bet on my picks to win but to place or show,” Bill said, “I pretend like I’m betting real money. I like to parlay my bets. I pick a bet in the first race and if I win I put my winnings on my pick in the second race and so on for all eight races. If all my picks win I win a lot of money.”<br><br>Actually we talked about things other than racing. Now and then however Bill would gleefully say things such as, “I won $300 yesterday.”<br><br>“You’re getting pretty good at this, or else pretty lucky.”<br><br>May would soon come and that meant the running of the Kentucky Derby. Bill announced that he and his big brother would go. He would get to see some of the horses he’d been reading about and watch the running of the Derby.<br><br>“Who’s your favorite in the Derby,” I asked.<br><br>“Bold Venture. I’ve saving my money so I can make some real bets at the track.”<br><br>“Good luck, buddy; hope you win a pocket full.”<br><br>After he got back I saw Bill at school. He looked a bit glum. I thought maybe he hadn’t got enough sleep on account of his trip to Louisville. I spoke to him cheerfully, I thought. “Hello Bill! How was the Derby? I see your favorite, Bold Venture won.”<br><br>“Yeah, everybody’s favorite. He ran a beautiful race all right,” he said.<br><br>“How much did you win?”<br><br>“Nothing. I lost $20.”<br><br>“That’s a lot of money to lose in the middle of a depression,” I said.<br><br>He didn’t say more about his day at the races. For the next two weeks he didn’t mention horses. He talked about everything else except horses. I thought his loss had destroyed his hobby. Then one day I heard a familiar refrain.<br><br>“Guess what! I made $150 yesterday on my parlay. Play money of course.”<br><br>I was glad to hear that Bill’s racetrack loss put only a temporary dent in Bill’s confidence.	1	2017-04-21 22:38:22.248993	2017-04-23 00:12:21.306781	2009	2	\N	\N	Non-Fiction	863	\N	\N
48	Crash	The female half of the family was immersed in Girl Scout activities. On this fine summer day both mother and daughters, were away on training missions. The mother left early in the family car for meetings in Columbus, about ninety miles from home. The girls, high school junior and senior, were at the Girl Scout camp, almost half way to Columbus. My boys were away, leaving me to hold down the fort alone. This was all right with me, for I had my Saturday chores to do. I would enjoy the peace and quiet. About midday, the quiet was shattered by the telephone.<br><br>“Mr. Jessee, this is the Highway Patrol. Your daughters have been in an accident. They are in the hospital in Bellefontaine,” the voice said. I was stunned and extremely fearful. What was I to do? Mary had our car. I felt helpless. There was only one thing to do.<br><br>After some fumbling around I managed to get a phone call to Mary. She was devastated to hear the news but took it as calmly as could be expected. She left her meeting and went to the hospital to face the situation. I tried to keep myself busy, but it was not possible to keep from fretting as time dragged on.<br><br>The day was done when Mary finally arrived with Catherine who looked shaken but not much hurt. Susanna was unconscious. She and their friend Sharon were being brought back to Lima Memorial Hospital by ambulance.<br><br>Five girls were in a car on their way to Camp Myera where they were to get training as councilors for summer camp; two girls in the front seat and three in the rear. Susanna and Catherine sat at the sides with Sharon between them. The driver of the car stopped at the highway, and then proceeded to cross. She evidently didn’t look a second time, since she pulled out into the path of an oncoming car, which slammed into the rear door of their car. Susanna sitting next to the impacted door took the brunt of the crash. She took not only the blow, but also simultaneously a hefty squeeze from the impact of her seatmates.<br><br>Only two girls received serious injuries. Both Sharon and Susanna suffered pelvic fractures; Sharon, broken ribs; Susanna, a broken collarbone and worst of all a brain contusion. Both were laid up for the summer.<br><br>Susanna was in intensive care for a day or so. Still in a coma, she was moved to a private room where she could have visitors; for what comfort it gave her. When I visited her one night, I could only look at her lying there helpless and pray for recovery. After a few days she did wake up. We got her a hospital bed and put her in the dining room where she spent the rest of the summer.<br><br>Susanna had prepared for a trip to a Girl Scout event in northern New York. Catherine was chosen as a substitute. She attended, had a good time, and felt guilty about it until she realized that she was in no way at fault.<br><br>Because son, Stephen, was a cadet in the Air Force Academy, we were afforded an invitation to parents weekend. We accepted the invitation and packed up Susanna complete with crutches and got aboard a flight to Colorado Springs to visit the academy and her brother. It seemed the least we could do for a girl who had spent the summer on her back.&nbsp;<br><br>Soon after the trip Susanna shed the need for her crutches and resumed her life normally--almost. The head injury left some brain damage affecting eye control that she has learned to cope with. Looking back on my most fearful day I am truly thankful that it was not far worse.	1	2017-04-21 22:32:27.008327	2017-04-23 00:12:21.337763	2007	3	\N	\N	\N	655	\N	\N
49	Deer	The late October sun in a sky unadulterated by any sign of a cloud beckoned me outdoors. On such a splendid day the sun reflected off the woods across the road revealing bright colors, red, yellow, and brown that are dulled on a cloudy day. Directly across the road was an open field flanked by a stand of woods on both right and left. I had in mind to mow the grass, hopefully for the last time before the cold breezes of autumn made such tasks unnecessary until spring. I went to the back yard and got my mower out. I noticed that it needed some minor repair work. What better time would there be to work on it? It would be ready to go in the spring. I made myself comfortable and began. I removed the blade from the mower and was about to take it to my basement and sharpen it when I was distracted by a noise in a corner of the yard. It was a bumping, scraping, clinking noise; unlike I had ever heard. Turning toward the noise, I saw the most unexpected sight of my life.<br><br>Emerging from somewhere above the chain-link fence at the corner of the house came a white tail deer, landing in my yard. He was fully antlered and in prime condition. I was sure that he had not come to help me mow grass. He ran toward the back of my yard on his rutting rampage. About half way to the back he sailed over the side fence as if there were no fence and trotted off through my neighbor’s yard and disappeared into a woods about a furlong behind the houses. I was simply amazed that the buck would choose a route through my back yard. Perhaps a slight breeze distorted the scent trail to the does.&nbsp;<br><br>After the initial shock of the sight I ambled over to the spot where the buck had landed in the yard, hoping to discover what had made all the clatter before he arrived. I was not disappointed. The steel pipe that supported the chain linkage at the top of the fence was no longer a straight piece of metal, but was bent to form a hundred twenty degree angle. Neither did the wire escape damage. It suffered several kinks and bends. I went around front to better assess the situation.<br><br>Shrubs grew at the west side of the north-facing house and a row of cedars I had planted as a windbreak were located two or three yards farther west. The arrangement provided a kind of lane between the shrubs and the cedars. A section of the back yard fence connected the corner post of the fence and the southwest corner of the house, closing the lane. What I found other than the severely distorted fence were deer tracks and a twelve-foot length of wild grapevine.<br><br>This is what I figure happened: The rutting buck with only one thing in mind was roaming the woods when his antlers became entangled in the grapevine. Trying to shake it off, he broke the vine loose, but it still clung to his antlers. He came out of the woods to get a better shake. Still seeking to rid himself of his burden he crossed the road and saw what he thought a place of refuge. Heading down the lane beside the house he came to the fence and tried to leap over it. The burden of the vine was too much. It slowed his leap and he hit the fence with a body blow that bent the bar and stopped him cold. He may have stepped on the vine to dislodge it, although it is unclear how he lost it, but free of his burden he continued on his appointed mission.<br><br>It took me the rest of the day and more to straighten the steel pipe, try to remove some of the dents and kinks left by the deer’s hooves in the chain linkage and put the fence back up. It was much more work than I bargained for. I just can’t remember when I managed to mow the grass, but I can’t forget the sight of a young buck dashing through my back yard.	1	2017-04-21 22:34:03.443058	2017-04-23 00:12:21.344513	2007	4	\N	\N	\N	724	\N	\N
52	Devotions	My family moved from a country place in Virginia to a Kentucky town when I was in third grade. It was not Momma’s choice. She had been reared in the country and would always remain a country gal. She dreaded the challenge of raising kids in town. There they would be exposed to other kids whom she didn’t know, and certainly to some who didn’t meet with her approval. In the country there would not be so many she didn’t know. I suppose she feared their influence on her own kids.<br><br>Momma was a Christian, raised a Methodist. Some people in her Church considered things like card games, dancing, and maybe just having fun as sins. Through Daddy’s persuasion, she joined the Presbyterian Church. Presbyterians don’t mind having fun. Those things that separate one from God are sins. Nevertheless, she clung to her list of sins and was never completely happy living in town. I imagine it was partly because she was separated from old friends and kin.<br><br>Our family lived a pretty normal life, I thought. I got along with other kids without picking up many of the bad habits of others.<br><br>The whole family went to Sunday School and Church each Sunday morning and back to Church that night. Then there was the midweek prayer meeting we seldom missed. This was not enough for Momma. Each night, just before bedtime we gathered to have our own devotions. I didn’t mind so much except that we had to learn a new Bible verse. Our meetings soon became a tradition. The only time we didn’t have one was after nighttime church, or after a special event, one of which was a revival meeting.<br><br>Revivals were fairly common when I was a child. Most all the Churches in town held a revival now and then. Even the Presbyterians had one I can remember. It was my favorite because the preacher was a mountain man who learned to imitate many birdcalls as he grew up and he demonstrated them for us. Momma was big on revivals. She never wanted to miss one. I wondered if she had a revival deficit in her youth.<br><br>I found a Baptist revival very interesting. The preacher shined a handful of silver dimes on the carpet every day, and used them to bribe [I meant entice] children to come to meetings. I liked it because there were lots of girls of about my age there. The Baptist Church was by far the biggest in town.<br><br>Momma’s favorite revival meetings seemed to be those held by the Nazarene Church. The church was the farthest one from home, and she tended to be late for meetings. That didn’t deter her. She gladly took me along, and when late, we got better seats down front. We were not too late. We always got there in time for offering. The services were of the usual format; hymns, scripture reading, more hymns, and the sermon. The sermon was usually special, I think. When the preacher was done I felt like I was a worse sinner than I had been before the meeting. Then we would sing “Just as I am” or some other hymn with an emotional tune. The preacher seemed to be saying I could be saved if I would come down front.&nbsp;<br><br>”Why don’t you go down?” Momma said. I couldn’t move even though she urged me further.<br><br>The week wasn’t over. There would be meetings every night for a week. We went back every night. Each night Momma urged me to go down when the preacher extended the invitation. Finally one night I yielded to her urge. That wasn’t the last time she urged me to go. Maybe she classed me among those backsliders they mentioned. Surely she was concerned for my salvation.<br><br>After the meetings were over we continued our tradition of nightly family devotions. We read scriptures, and prayed as usual. I still didn’t understand the concept of going down to shake the preacher’s hand. How could that bring me salvation? I remained confused about that; too embarrassed to ask.<br><br>When I was older and began to understand that nobody was without sin, God had already given me faith to believe in his son, Jesus. I was relieved when it finally dawned on me that a trip down the aisle to shake hands with the preacher was nothing more than a public confession of my faith. I believe that Momma’s nightly devotions had far more influence on me than either other kids or her revivals had.	1	2017-04-21 22:40:25.463981	2017-04-23 00:12:21.351303	2007	1	\N	\N	\N	797	\N	\N
60	Reunion Vacation 1988	The June night was clear with a bright starry sky above. We sat around a little campfire that was not for the heat but for the effect. We always thought a campout was incomplete without a fire to gaze into. It had been a daunting, sometimes frustrating task to get the assembled family together; for every date I suggested someone objected. Eventually we found a time we could agree on, and here we were sitting around a campfire as happy as could be. Some even wanted to sing songs and they did. Now and then the sound of something scampering about outside our circle aroused the attention of someone who ventured out to investigate. Each time it happened the same report came back. It was only a skunk or two scouring the campground for scraps of food that some camper may have dropped. Before long the little fire ebbed, yawns traveled around the circle and it was off to our tents and to bed.<br><br>Our camp was in Cades Cove, a part of the Great Smokey Mountains National Park. Cades Cove is an area of not quite flat land, surrounded by mountain ridges. The cove was once a community of farms having a loop road around the perimeter of the farms with houses located at appropriate intervals along the road. The houses are well maintained and the farmlands are tilled as if they were still real farms.<br><br>Family members frequently left the camp to explore some of the many features of the park. One day the whole group, on a scenic drive, located a short loop trail designated as a nature trail and decided that a short loop would be just right. From a small parking lot the trail rose into the woods above and disappeared around a bend. The whole gang took to the trail in single file to view the wonders of nature the trail might offer. The usual trailside woodland sights were abundant but not outstanding for one used to such trails. Bye-and-bye a cracking sound came from our left, and looking up the hill about thirty yards we all saw a big black bear. He was busy ripping apart a decaying stump of a long ago felled tree. We all stopped to watch him do his work, but the bear took no notice of us. By the time we left, the stump was demolished and the bear was busily slurping up the grubs he had uncovered. We hesitated in the parking lot at the end of our short hike to reorient ourselves. Presently one of the kids yelled out and pointed towards Dorothy who noticed a sniffing sound behind her. She turned to see a big black bear close behind her. I don’t think she wet her pants, but I think she came close to it. The bear, seeing no ready food, moved on. Once Dorothy’s nerves settled we continued our motor tour and returned to camp where Dick took over the task of rustling up a good supper for the whole gang. Dick is a take-charge guy who loves to cook and keep everything organized. We were all grateful for that.<br><br>The next morning we decided to hike up to one of the many waterfalls. We left after breakfast without Dorothy who preferred to remain in camp. Was it the hike or the bears? As with nearly all falls hikes its all uphill one way and all downhill the other, but a beautiful sight to behold in the middle of the trip. A mountain stream stretching uneasily in its bed and seeking a resting place, suddenly finds itself being torn apart, accelerating wildly over rocks and falling into a pool of turbulent water, but finding no peace here moves on still searching for a place to rest.<br><br>Meanwhile, back at the camp Dorothy sat peacefully in her resting place reading her book. Unnoticed by her, a bear came out of the woods and sauntered toward our campsite, no doubt attracted by a large metal food cooler sitting atop the camp table. He wasted no time in attacking the cooler. The noise of the bear’s teeth biting at the corner of the cooler alerted Dorothy that she was no longer alone. Just a glance started her hightailing it for the restrooms and locking the door behind her. The bear bit and pawed at the cooler until he finally became frustrated at his lack of progress, gave up and departed leaving not only his tooth marks but also a tooth imbedded in the cooler. Dorothy didn’t reveal how long she occupied the restroom but the bear was long gone before she ventured out. I don’t believe she enjoyed the book any more that day, but she did inform a couple of passersby who were looking for bears that there really were bears around. The hikers returned at about the same time that the park ranger arrived on his rounds. The ranger inquired of who was responsible for the cooler and upon finding out it was Dick gave him a royal chewing out, reminding him that all food was to be stored inside the car. Fortunately the food was left intact and we ate supper again that day.<br><br>The next day I made a wrong movement dislocating a vertebra in my lower back. I was out of commission but Susanna took pity on me and helped me into a car and headed off to find a chiropractor in Maryville. I don’t know what happened in camp that day but they were still doing what tourist campers do. By the next day I was still laid up and we made a second trip to the doctor. I was still sore but at least I could get up and walk a little. When we returned my sister Margaret and niece Jana were in camp to visit the gang. They had come from Oak Ridge to see us. I guess I was sorry company for them but we were glad to see one another and had a nice visit.<br><br>After we broke camp the next day and loaded our gear into our cars, nobody was in a hurry to leave. There was a lot of hugging and maybe a tear or two shed before we finally said our farewells. We’d had a great time, not because of what we had seen or done, but because of the rare pleasure of being together again.<br><br>FOOTNOTE:&nbsp;<br><br>Present: David, Katyna, Andre, Ursula, Stephen, Catherine, Shawn. Susanna, Dick, Rachel, Emily, my guest Dorothy, and Don<br><br>I challenge all who were there to write their version of the reunion. It will be interesting.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:04:37.561291	2017-04-23 00:12:21.411521	2007	6	\N	\N	\N	1139	\N	\N
47	Blizzard	Winters in northwestern Ohio are less terrible than some folks claim. Yes, some days are cold and dreary, others sunny and colder, sometimes chilling the thermometer to less than zero. There are usually three or four snowfalls that seldom exceed six inches in depth so that one must shovel it out of the way, or that blesses parents with the presence of their children at home because the school bus doesn’t run. Of course the children don’t mind: a day off from school, a chance to play in the snow.<br><br>Visualize this scene: The night has been cold and crisp. A super cooled mist wafted through on a gentle breeze and sunrise is at hand. A thin cloud cover blocks the view of the rising sun but presents a bright gray sky. The world has a ghostly appearance. Frost covers everything in sight. This is no ordinary frost. This is hoarfrost, the kind that is built of billions of tiny icicles that cling to every naked branch and twig in the slumbering woods beside the road. The thin clouds dissipate as the sun climbs into the sky. Slivers of sunlight filter through the trees transforming the ghostly forest into a brilliant display of all the world’s diamonds that emit a myriad of colors through tiny prisms. What can be more spectacular?<br><br>On a different day, one not so cold, imagine a wet snow falling. Big flakes adhere to branches of the trees and catch other flakes as they plummet downward and lay white ribbons of icing on every dark colored branch. There may be virtually no snow under a tall tree that captures nearly all the snow shower. Evergreen trees don’t like this kind of snow, no matter its beauty. The weight can bring it drooping to the ground. Kids, on the other hand, love it. It’s the best kind for making snowballs, and yes, snowmen.&nbsp;<br><br>Most days were ordinary days, some with snow on the ground and some without, some were dreary and others bright, nevertheless winter was one of my favorite seasons. Grass never needed mowing, nor were there weeds to chop. Outside noises were muted and fewer. The symphony orchestra performed concerts and the little theater put on plays. It seemed as if the community woke up after a long nap. I liked January especially because the Christmas rush was over and it was too early to worry about income tax.<br><br>My love for the season came to an abrupt halt in 1978, at least for a week or two. Mardelle and I retired for the night amid the sound of a blustery and whining wind. That continued throughout the night. I know because we were awakened numerous times by the whine and bluster, but little did I know how much snow was carried on that wind. We were up early to see what had happened during the night. As I expected, a drift or two covered the driveway and the frigid wind kept piling it higher. We had some breakfast and tried to relax, all the while wondering how long the snow would continue. We watched the storm through one window then another. The radio announced that most everything was closed for the day, and from what I could see it was no wonder. About mid-morning the electric power failed.<br><br>“I surely hope the power isn’t off very long,” said Mardelle, “this could be very bad.”<br><br>“You’re dag-gone right it could be,” I said. “Without electricity the furnace won’t work. The temperature is near zero and the wind is howling out there. We’re just not prepared for this. Blizzards are supposed to happen out on the northern plains, not here.”<br><br>“This is the first one I can remember.”<br><br>“Same here. I’ve lived here over thirty years and I’ve seen nothing like this,” I said, trying to defend my unpreparedness.&nbsp;<br><br>I got out our camp stove and she heated some lunch and coffee for us. The house seemed cooler by this time and we put on sweaters. The wind and snow persisted, ever deepening the drifts and even moving some of them to new locations. The house got cooler and forced us to don more clothing as the power outage continued. Even as my feet got colder I was glad for one thing; I had put an extra layer of insulation over the ceiling.<br><br>By late afternoon the temperature had dropped to fifty degrees and we were beginning to think that we would have to get in bed in the dark with our clothes on to keep warm. Then something wonderful happened; the furnace turned on. It took a long time, or so it seemed, to restore the house to normal temperature. Maybe it was luck or maybe it was providence, but we had dodged the bullet. The storm raged on through the night but the electricity kept flowing and we woke to a warm house. There seemed to be no new snow but we had aplenty that was being whipped around by a persistent wind.<br><br>I screwed up my courage, bundled up and ventured out doors in the biting wind to see what I could see. Snow was piled against the back door, so I chose the front, which was protected by a porch. There was no place to go without wading through waist-deep drifts. I went back in with the intent of getting a snow shovel from the attached garage to clear off the porch. I was surprised to find that the garage was filled with snow, at least to the tops of two cars parked inside. The garage door lacked an inch of closing to the floor, letting in the snowdrift. I was able to retrieve a shovel and cleared the porch of snow so that I could to get a clear view of the road. The windswept road was fairly clear except for some three- and four-foot drifts blocking passage. There was no use fretting about the drifts so long as the wind blew in shifting directions; the drifts would move too.<br><br>Strong winds continued for yet another day shuffling the drifts, reshaping and building some even deeper. Road crews worked through the night attempting to open the roads, but in a short time drifts closed them again. The wind did finally settle down so that some roads were cleared for traffic. It was a wonderful sight to see an enterprising man with a snow blade on his truck soliciting business in our neighborhood. I was inspired to shovel the snow out of my garage from between our cars and was glad to pay whatever the snow mover guy asked to clear my driveway. It was mighty good to be free to be able to get out of our prison after three or four days. Even so, it was more than a week later before the ten-foot drifts throughout the county were defeated.<br><br>Spring came pretty much on schedule, clearing most of the land of snow, but many piles just lay there not noticing that it was spring until they finally succumbed to the radiance of the sun. When I think back to the blizzard of ’78 I thank God for men who are willing to brave storms at their own peril, especially the electricians.	1	2017-04-21 22:30:35.116888	2017-04-23 00:12:21.313565	2007	5	\N	\N	Non-Fiction	1251	Middle	\N
90	Kays of Miami	At the Dayton, Ohio airport Mardelle and I boarded an airplane bound for Miami to visit our friends, Harold and Marti Kay. We were long time friends with the Kays. Marti was probably Mardelle’s best friend in Lima. Harold had been in the sales department at Westinghouse when layoffs occurred and he got a job with Pan American Airline in Miami. During our flight we were surprised to discover Lima friends, Bill and Fran Frichie as fellow passengers aiming to spend Thanksgiving with their daughter.<br><br>The reunion with the Kays was both pleasant and welcome. We spent many hours catching up on the happenings in our lives since last we were together. Mardelle was particularly interested to learn about their daughter Sandra who had contracted rheumatoid arthritis at an early age. I’m sure, that among other things, the commonality of Sandra’s disease and Mardelle’s provided a strong tie between Mardelle and Marti.<br><br>The Kays were excellent hosts, much better than I’d have been. One day Marti packed a picnic basket and treated her landlocked guests to lunch at the beach. It was a gorgeous day with a gentle ocean breeze singing quietly in the tall palms that overlooked the white sandy beach. It was a rare pleasure to spend a late November day with each other in such enticing surroundings. The lunch was good, too.<br><br>Another day Harold handed me his car keys and invited me to drive down across the keys. It was an all day trip from Maimi to Key West and back. What we saw was not particularly spectacular but it was a very enjoyable ride as we drove along bridge after bridge from island to island. Across the long bridges it was almost like cruising in a little ship. The islands were as short respites from the constant over-water scene. I don’t recall much about our walk around Key West except that we had a good time exploring it.<br><br>Thanksgiving Day promised to be mild and calm in sunny Florida.<br><br>“Mardelle and I will fix us a nice dinner for this evening,” Marti said, “What are you guys going to do today?”<br><br>“ I thought we would take the boat over to the everglades and try one of the trails. You need any help before we go?” said Harold.<br><br>“We can manage OK,” said Marti.<br><br>Harold had been a sports car enthusiast in Ohio. He had a little MG that was almost impossible for me to get into. He took it on sports car rallies where he traced a predetermined route. Each driver in the rally was required to drive the route passing all check points and return in a set time span. I tried it once and got hopelessly lost.<br><br>Harold had evidently given up sports cars in favor of a sailboat. He removed the sail so the boat could be paddled through shallow water. He sought out a loop trail that meandered through the mangrove trees of the everglades. These trees were short, reaching maybe ten feet above the water in which the tree grew. Each tree had many roots extending out from the plant and descending at right angles into the water, reminding me of giant insect legs.<br><br>We entered the trail paddling slowly, anticipating the sighting of swamp wildlife. It was a kind of strange feeling, sitting in a boat surrounded by a strange looking forest. The trail had many twists and turns relieved by an occasional short straight stretch. With each bend in the trail we were alert for some form of animal wildlife, an alligator, a bird or perhaps a snake. But it was all in vain. We traveled the trail for an hour and a half and what we saw was the same as what we saw when we entered the trail. So we hitched up the boat to the car to make ready for the trip back to the Kay’s for a Thanksgiving dinner.<br><br>“Before we go,” said Harold, “let’s take a walk around the boardwalk trail.”<br><br>“Suits me.” I said, and we started our walk and were soon over the water of the wetland. After only a short walk we came across a well-fed alligator out of the water, lolling in the sun to warm his blood. He was a beautiful animal, as alligators go. From the boardwalk we could see much of the flora surrounding us, the green mangrove forest we had just exited and in another direction, a sea of grass gently rippling in the breeze. Farther on down the trail I noticed a strange sight, a couple of feather dusters hanging just above the water from a woody plant. Proceeding on the trail, we drew closer and I could see that what I’d seen was really a big bird hung out to dry. His wings were spread so they could get maximum sunshine. He was a fishing bird with no oil on his feathers to shed water. Evidently he could stay under water with less effort, lacking the buoyancy of air trapped in his feathers by oil.<br><br>We arrived back at the Kay household with good appetites and looking forward to a big meal. I followed Harold in, sniffing the air expecting to get a whiff of the goodies the women had cooked up. Hmm, it smelled as we left this morning. Odd.<br><br>“Surprise,” said Marti, “Our friends invited us to their house for dinner. We need to be there in two hours.&nbsp;	1	2017-04-22 16:54:26.525079	2017-04-23 00:12:21.418102	2009	4	\N	\N	\N	946	\N	\N
8	Jenny	Through my dinning room window I could see my next-door neighbor’s back door. Little more than a driveway separated the window from Dr. Wright’s house. So far, the Wrights had four children, the youngest, twins about two years old, the others school age. On warm sunny days Jean, the mother, put the twins, Jeff and Jenny out to play in the driveway, just outside the back door. She would spread a blanket or a rug on the pavement and put out some toys for their entertainment. There in the shade of the house and some trees they would play contentedly for some time. No doubt this gave Jean some respite from having them underfoot and she could keep an eye on them from the kitchen window. This would be especially helpful if she were preparing dinner.<br><br>It was one of those rare days in June, of which poets speak to imply perfect days. Jean had put the twins out to play in their shady place. I happened to glance out my window and saw them playing with the toys their mom had provided. A second glance revealed something I hadn’t anticipated. Jenny had shed all her clothes and was playing normally as well-behaved kids are expected to do. Certainly Jenny did not feel compelled by the heat to strip. Perhaps she did not like to be encumbered in her play by clothing. Jeff took no notice and went on with his games. Soon Mother took notice, however, and retrieved Jenny and her clothes.&nbsp; When next I noticed the children were playing peacefully, suitably clothed.<br><br>A week or two later I saw the twins in their usual spot playing nicely. Things around the neighborhood were quiet and peaceful. It was another prefect day in June. Jean came out of the back door and found only<br><br>Jeff where she had left him and his sister a few minutes earlier.<br><br>“Jenny,” she called. No answer. Jenny was not to be seen. Instead, there were her clothes lying nearby. Jean picked up the little dress and hurried to the sidewalk in front of the house. She hesitated, looking up the street, then down. “Jenny! Jenny!” she called, her voice agitated, as she headed down the street after her naked daughter.<br><br>About five minutes later Jean came back up the walk with the young truant at least half dressed in tow. She was probably hoping that all of the neighbors were away for the afternoon.	1	2017-04-18 00:02:41.849648	2017-04-23 00:12:21.330863	2005	1	\N	\N	\N	424	\N	\N
57	New House	The house on Albert St. was comfortable, handy to work and affordable. We had agreeable neighbors who were helpful when needed and pleasant to visit. The problem was that my family was growing so fast. Once the two boys and their little sister were put to bed there was little room for an overnight guest, usually their granny who was obliged to spend the night on special occasions such as Christmas Eve. It was good we had a couch.<br><br>There were memories attached to the place besides the wheezing sound of the locomotive we called Squeaky Wheels. There was the shock I received the evening I came home to hear on the radio that even as I traveled, a tornado had sneaked into town, rambled up Market Street, turned north and left via Cole Street while cutting a path of destruction. I recall being alarmed at hearing our neighbor tell Mary that she fell off the roof. Juanita didn’t look the worse for wear and I was relieved to learn that she had only started her menstrual cycle. I shall never forget the late nights when I filed the ring off my injured and swollen finger, or when Mary and I put cold, wet towels on a naked baby to bring her fever down to a livable level. I have many other memories not so traumatic but they might seem mundane.<br><br>There seemed to be only a few houses available at the time and fewer still that I could afford. We had seen new houses being built around town and took note of the builders’ names. Most of the houses going up were meant for young families.<br><br>“Let’s go see Henry Cardone,” Mary said, “I’ve heard a lot about him.”<br><br>“Anything good?” I asked.<br><br>“I think he has a good reputation,” she said. I’ll make an appointment to talk to him.”<br><br>“I build only one style of house right now,” said Henry, “That’s how I can keep the price down. There are a lot of young folks who need them. Would you like to look at one?”<br><br>“Let’s go see one,” I said, and we were soon on a tour of his prototype.<br><br>It was a single story, two- bedroom bungalow style house with a floored, unfinished attic. [Oh oh. Work ahead!] The living room and the kitchen- dining area occupied the front of the house, while the bedrooms were in back with the bathroom in between.<br><br>“I have one under construction on Glenwood Ave. that will be available soon,” said Henry. “You can go there and check out the neighborhood if you wish. If you don’t like it there I can show you another location. And by the way, all my houses come with a full basement.”<br><br>“Looks like a pretty nice house. It should be big enough for the family for a few years after you finish the attic rooms,” said Mary, looking at me.<br><br>“Yeah,” I gulped. “how much will this cost?”<br><br>“My price is $10,000,” said Henry. “You’re a veteran, so I can get you a GI loan at 4% interest.”<br><br>“Thank you, we’ll be in touch,” I said and headed for Glenwood Ave. to check out the neighborhood. It was a nice looking street with an old house or two and several newer houses. There were a few vacant lots where I was sure there would be new houses pretty soon. The location near the edge of town was convenient to our needs and only a ten-minute drive from my workplace.<br><br>“’What do you think,” I asked Mary as we stared at the hole in the ground.<br><br>“The neighborhood seems good but I could tell more about it if there were a house there,” said Mary.<br><br>“Right,” I said, “but what bothers me is that it will cost three months pay just for the down payment and we’ll need a new stove and refrigerator.”<br><br>“We’ve got some money in a savings account. Maybe Mom can lend us a little,” Mary offered.<br><br>“Umm, I hate to ask, and besides don’t forget the new baby that’s coming,” I said.<br><br>“How can I forget that?” she said, rubbing her aching back.<br><br>We discussed the matter to the exclusion of most everything else for the next few days and finally decided to take the plunge. We somehow scraped a down payment together and expected to move into a new home in early December. Meantime I found myself stopping by the construction to see how it was progressing. By Thanksgiving I was getting anxious, for there was much work to be done. On one such day I found the windows fogged up so that they had become just part of the walls. I was sure that the place would never be livable, until I realized that the plastering had just been finished. It did eventually dry out. The painting was done, the hardwood floors laid and finish work was finally completed. December had passed and like most projects of its kind, it was tardy. We celebrated a birthday for the last time at our old place and moved into our new house as soon as our kitchen appliances were delivered on Groundhog Day, 1952.&nbsp;<br><br>It was a nice looking house, finished in gray cedar shakes and having a picture window at the left of the entrance stoop and a smaller one at the right. A cement walk led to the gravel driveway at the right side of the house. Yet it looked forlorn, for the lawn was bare of any sign of grass, but February chill transformed the mud to solid ground. Oh well, spring would soon return the mud and the chore of sowing seeds for a lawn.<br><br>Before we really got settled into our new house our family increased by one. Two weeks after we took possession of our new house we brought home our second daughter. Now we were ready to start a new home. What better for a house warming?<br><br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:01:54.29528	2017-04-23 00:12:21.358066	2007	3	\N	\N	\N	1056	\N	\N
56	Songs	Granddaddy Wells set his first grandson on his knee and sang to him when he was but a little tyke, not yet in school. I was the little tyke. I have no recollection of what song he sang. He may have made it up on the spot. I remember hearing it said that Granddaddy once led a choral group in his younger days.<br><br>Momma sometimes sang a song that was so sad that it made me cry every time she sang it. It was a ballad about a child who took sick and died. The words were very sad and the tune was made to match. I never learned the song; it was too sad to think about. She sang other songs however and I learned at least one from her. It was a caution to young lovers. She seemed happy when she sang it.<br><br><br><blockquote>“The moon has his eyes on you.&nbsp;<br>So be careful of what you do.<br>Every time you go a strolling with your ladylove<br>Mr. Moon is watching from above.<br>Big eyes way up in the skies<br>So be wise; don’t let him surprise.<br>Don’t try to tease, for way up through the trees&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>The moon has his eyes on you.”</blockquote><br>Daddy had a little tune he liked to sing now and then. It went “---- jadda jadda jing jing jing.” He may have sung some other stuff, but I don’t remember anything else.<br><br>My favorite song in high school glee club was “Aunt Dinah’s Quilting Party”. Quilting parties were pretty rare by that time but the song was fun to sing.<br><br>At college I joined the glee club for the fun of it. Professor Earl Hobson Smith of the English department had written a play about Stephen Foster and of course he needed singers in the cast. His play was performed, not only on campus, but also at several high schools in the area. We sang “Camptown Races”, “Old Folks at Home”, “Swanee River”, “Jeannie with the Light Brown Hair”, the nonsensical “Oh Susannah” and a few other famous Foster songs, and had fun doing it.<br><br>Most of my favorite songs were created during the Great Depression and World War II and played by the big bands of the swing era. Swing tunes such as “In the Mood”, “Tuxedo Junction” and “String of Pearls” were great favorites of the jitterbugging crowd. I liked the tunes but the dance was too energetic for my body. I liked the love songs better. I could dance to those tunes and appreciate their lyrics. Unlike the stuff that’s peddled today, the songs were set to nice singable tunes, and had words that seemed to come from the heart. “You’d be so Nice to Come Home To” doesn’t sound like a plea for a mere fling. “Moonlight Becomes You” expresses a man’s admiration for his lady’s beauty in the moonlight. ‘Night and Day”, “Deep Purple”, “In the Still of the Night” were songs with tender feelings and beautiful tunes that were sung and played at dances. I was always disappointed in the music of a dance that didn’t include “Stardust” but I usually left the dance singing a tune the band had played.<br><br>Big bands declined after the 1940’s and so did the new songs of the kind they played. What happened to the songwriters? I guess their audience dwindled. Was it because people were busy raising the baby boomers. The music that followed lacked the happy melodious quality of earlier times. Was it because of the atom bomb, the cold war, general pessimism? At any rate, new songs with great melodies have been rare since the 40’s.<br><br>I take solace in the advance of technology that makes it possible to hear the long forgotten “oldies” almost any time. I can always sing one of my old favorites such as “Mammy’s Little Baby Loves Shortenin’ Bread”.<br><br>	1	2017-04-21 22:46:50.593879	2017-04-23 00:12:21.364703	2007	1	\N	\N	\N	689	\N	\N
91	Foxy	The old fox and the young duck walked the avenue to the theater to watch the people arrive for the latest Elvis show. The pair had become fellow travelers when the fox discovered the scrawny duck alone and looking lost and offered to help him find food. The fox remained in the shadows, as foxes are naturally shy, but he lost sight of his little buddy who moved in toward the crowd for a better view and in hope of finding a few grains of popcorn. The little duck unfortunately moved a little too close to the crowd and was mashed to a mere greasy spot by a huge foot that came down on him. The fox saw what happened to his little friend and was terribly sad to see the sight.<br><br>“Oh rats!” said the fox, “In a few more days he would have been fattened enough for a fine meal. Now I have to start all over.”	1	2017-04-22 16:55:08.281704	2017-04-23 00:12:21.424449	2009	7	\N	\N	\N	161	\N	\N
58	Porch	The sounds of an ambulance or fire engine in the distance growing ever louder break the relative quiet of the evening. The wailing scream with its slurring pitch is replaced by a whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop, then back to the scream. The sound, though muffled, invades the house. Outside on the back porch the sound volume is annoyingly higher. Soon the sirens fade in the distance and only the din of normal traffic is heard.<br><br>On a summer evening when the heat of the day has waned it is pleasant to sit on the back porch and listen to the sounds that abound. Ignore the din of the traffic, now declining. As the light of day begins to dim we hear cicadas drone their evensong. They make a rasping jarring sound. My grandparents called them jar flies. We hear one in this tree and before it stops for a short rest, another over there takes on the song. Even while the cicadas perform, a mocking bird chimes in with his never-ending repertoire. Does he consider himself the chief singer among birds? Another bird speaks his piece and moves on.<br><br>A dog next door barks. Another, then another answers him, until all the neighborhood dogs have their say. They tire of their barking, but the mocking bird and the cicadas continue. From a few blocks away bells chime out the hour. They must be church bells, for a short time ago they were playing hymns. Squirrels are still playing in the trees, chirping at each other. They sound a little like birds with sore throats.<br><br>As darkness approaches the cicadas begin to quiet down. The crickets and their ilk are tuning up for their nightly serenade. A little toad hops toward the cover of a flowerbed. A few minutes pass and a soft peep comes from his spot among the flowers. A peep comes from another place and then another. They are on all sides of the yard.<br><br>Now that darkness is upon us, some katydids begin to accuse Katy of something, while others deny it. They continue the argument far into the night, apparently with no decision.<br><br>We hear the lonesome whistle of a train going through town, whistling for each street crossing. Catherine likes this sound when she is in bed. It lulls her to sleep she says.<br><br>It is a rare night. An unexpected sound comes from a nearby tree. It is a wavering call, descending in pitch: the call of a screech owl. I am reminded of an owl that was tricked one night. A group of night hikers stopped in a clearing where scrub bushes dotted the area. The leader turned on a tape recording of the call of a screech owl. He repeated the call several times at short intervals. A few minutes later, an owl settled into a nearby bush, looking for an intruder. He had come to protect his territory. Flashlights blazing, the whole group stepped forward to get a good look at the little bird. As soon as the owl regained his sight he took off, no doubt miffed at being tricked.<br><br>Jay, the resident dog, lies in the yard, evidently oblivious to the sounds of the night. Should it rain he will come into the shelter of the porch. Otherwise he will be will content with his nap into the night.<br><br>When I was a child, every house I saw had a front porch. Most were equipped with a swing and sported a rocking chair or two. In warm weather people sat out on many of them, watching their neighbors walk by, or maybe waving to a passing car.<br><br>Sometimes on a country road I noticed a porch with a machine of some kind, such as a washing machine, sitting with or without people, or maybe with a hound dog. A house on a hillside would likely reveal the porch as a shelter for a piece of machinery.<br><br>Houses were spaced closer together in town. People living side by side could easily converse from their front porches. Kids played on the sidewalk and the front yards. There was scarcely a time in good weather when all the porches were vacant. Someone was usually there to keep an eye on the children at play. Strangers were easy to spot. Rarely was there any serious mischief undetected.<br><br>It seems to me that a front porch is a good thing. It provides good shelter when entering the house from the street. It gives the paperboy a wide target. It is a great place to get fresh air and to get away from TV and other indoor distractions.<br><br>Few houses built since World War II have front porches. People who want to get outside go to the back porch, if they have one, or the patio, or just leave home altogether. A person could live in a no-porch neighborhood for a year without ever seeing many of his neighbors. We don’t have much of a front porch, but I feel very thankful for a back porch, especially on a summer night.<br><br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:03:13.649468	2017-04-23 00:12:21.3712	2007	7	\N	\N	\N	871	\N	\N
53	Dorothy Jean	Dorothy Jean seemed to me to be a flaky character, her mind being somewhere apart from her body. Mardelle and I became acquainted with her while working at the Humane Society bingo games, formed by animal lovers to help support their animal shelter. Some of the volunteers stayed around for a social visit after the games.<br><br>Dorothy Jean was a somewhat irregular attendee of the games, but she was there often enough to become pretty well acquainted with us. She was a nice looking woman, with almost always a pleasant look. She smiled easily. Her straight hair flowed naturally from the crown, cut in a style that tapered toward her neck and copped to expose her ears. Despite a bit of graying she managed to keep it a shade of brown that matched her eyes.<br><br>For the next few years I encountered Dorothy Jean at bingo and sometimes at the Encore Theater, where she was an active member. By this time Mardelle had grown tired of marriage and we had parted by mutual agreement. I kept helping at the bingo games when I could. One night near the end of the games Dorothy Jean proposed a little party at a restaurant. I headed for the restaurant after the games. I expected to find Dorothy Jean there, but found only another Dorothy of our group there. Dorothy Jean never showed up, so we waited, had a snack and went home, wondering what happened to Dorothy Jean. On another occasion Dorothy Jean invited me to call her and handed me a note with a phone number. I tried to call her. It turned out that she had given me the number of her previous home. Flaky? Maybe so, but I found her to be fun to be around; good company.<br><br>Dorothy Jean invited me to escort her to her high school reunion. She was delighted that I accepted. She said she had always gone to these affairs alone. She’d never felt like asking someone to go with her before. She was a long-time single woman, never married. The reunion was a dinner-dance. She proudly introduced me to her former classmates, made me feel special. She was a moderately good dancer. There was no cheek-to-cheek dancing for us. She stood shoulder high to me. She was a nice armful though; not fat, but far from skinny. It was an enjoyable evening for us both.<br><br>Dorothy Jean was a genealogist of sorts. She and her mother had made many trips to county seats, and to old graveyards in Virginia and Ohio, seeking names of dead relatives. One great great-grandmother had been particularly elusive. When we could find nothing on the web we began traveling to prospective places to look for names to add to her collection. We traveled to the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia and hunted a graveyard. We also located a farm that had once belonged to a great grandfather. We drove up a dirt road for about half a mile to a ramshackle house and barn. We were greeted by a yappy dog. An old man came out of the house and spoke to us. Dorothy Jean introduced us and told him of our business there. Momentarily the old man invited us in. We walked in, gingerly threading our way between machines and furniture for a conversation that lasted at least half an hour. When we left we were old friends. Dorothy Jean never met anyone who was a stranger for long.<br><br>Dorothy Jean loved Virginia, a varied land with beaches, rolling hills, mountains and broad valleys. We visited it often over several years. One time I packed my camp gear, intending to camp out all the way across Virginia. We started out with a campground in mind. By the time we reached the place, rain was inevitable. Who wants to set up camp in the rain? We sought a dry place for the night. The same thing happened the next day. The strange thing was that the days were mostly dry and pleasant. We ended up not camping at all. We visited all the historic places along our route; Thomas Jefferson’s University of Virginia, Monticello, Williamsburg and even Skyline Drive, and more. She really loved historic places, especially those in the South.<br><br>We enjoyed going to concerts by the Lima Symphony Orchestra, and plays at the Encore Theater. Dorothy Jean sometimes had a role in a play, and often acted as an usher. She said that it was as an usher that she first noticed me with my first wife, Mary.<br><br>Dorothy Jean liked my children and all four of them liked her. I never knew anyone who didn’t like her. She was a friendly and caring person who could take being kidded in good humor. Once she let her hair grow and got a permanent wave that made her look like little orphan Annie. She took a lot of ribbing about that. She laughed about it but could barely wait to get back to her old style.<br><br>It was evident early on in our dating experience that Dorothy Jean was in love with me. She had been in love before with a young man she would have married, but for his Jewish mother who would not accept a non-Jewish daughter in law. I was quite fond of Dorothy Jean. I probably loved her in my own peculiar way. I was reluctant to marry after my previous marriage, which had been less satisfying than I had hoped for. After five years of dating and taking trips together I finally realized that we were right for each other.<br><br>The wedding took place in May, on the hottest day of the whole year, with friends and family members present. In the years of our marriage the proudest declaration made by Dorothy Jean was “I inherited a family of four children and nine grandchildren.”	1	2017-04-21 22:41:43.960823	2017-04-23 00:12:21.377911	2007	7	\N	\N	\N	1001	\N	\N
54	Evening at Grandma’s	The mile walk from school seemed a lot shorter than the mile walk to school early in the morning. There were things to see along the road that were not seen by morning light. Could it have been the rush to beat the final toll of school bell that made things invisible? At any rate the walk home was leisurely. Did I say home? I had no home. My parents had moved away and left me with Grandma so that I could walk that mile until I finished third grade.<br><br>I was intrigued the day I got home to find Grandma in the back yard tending a large cast iron vat boiling over a small wood fire. She was making soap. The scraps of fat and bacon rinds she had been saving were in the vat with water to which she had added a can or two of lye. She tested the mixture with a feather. If the feather came out eaten away more cooking was needed or perhaps more far. Once the feather came out whole the soap was about done. The fire could be doused and the vat left to cool. The brownish yellow soap floated on top of a liquid and could be lifted off to be cut into bars when cool.<br><br>Another time she was making apple butter in a huge brass kettle over a wood fire. She gave me the job of stirring with the wooden paddle provided with a long handle so that I could stir while standing away from the fire.<br><br>Normally there was no special activity in the yard to interest me. Grandma might have been sewing pieces of cloth together for a quilt or preparing vegetables for cooking or one of any of a number of things. My uncles soon came home and I could watch while they chopped wood for the kitchen stove or for the fireplace. Sometimes I helped round up the cows for milking. I was pretty much on my own until suppertime, but before supper my aunt Tump came home from school and urged me to do my homework. She taught in the elementary schools somewhere nearby, but not in my school. She helped me with my homework sometimes, especially spelling. She was single and had no children of her own so she liked to mother me a bit. Once in a while I misbehaved and she said, ”If you were a kid of mine I’d warm up your behind,” but she never did. Not so with Grandma, she knew exactly where she could find a switch of just the right size.<br><br>“It sure smells good in here, Grandma,” I said as I stuck my head in the kitchen.<br><br>“It’s the cornbread. It’s about done. If you eat a good supper I’ve got some apple cobbler for your dessert,” she said. “Don’t go far away, supper’s just about ready.<br><br>Not long after that the “Supper’s ready,“ call brought the whole family to the dining table. Granddaddy sat at one end of the table and Grandma at the other. Bowls of steaming food sat ready for eating. Whoever was close picked up a bowl, helped himself to a portion and passed it on. Creamy mashed potatoes with gravy, greens of some kind, pickled green beans and of course cornbread and butter, and plenty of buttermilk provided enough food for everyone. We could look forward to fried chicken on Sunday.<br><br>“I like your pickles beans, Grandma. How do you make ‘em?” I said.<br><br>“Oh, about the same way I make sauerkraut. Put ‘em in a big crock and let ‘m ferment,” she said. I had a second helping, and by the way, the apple cobbler was great. I left the table satisfied knowing that if I were hungry at bedtime Grandma would give me a glass of buttermilk poured over crumbled cornbread.<br><br>The meal over and the dishes washed (sometimes I wiped) we saved the dishwater and cooking and table scraps for the pigs and abandoned the kitchen. After the pigs were fed and the chores were done for the day my uncles walked to the village for their nightly confab with their cronies. The rest of us assembles in the main part of the house or on the front porch..&nbsp;<br><br>The main room had beds in three corners and plenty of space in front of a large fireplace to sit and talk or read. Light for reading was nothing to brag about. A kerosene lamp on each side of the mantle provided the light. Grandma frequently read her “Pathfinder” magazine. Granddaddy would rather talk.<br><br>“Looks like I’m going to have to cut the price of my buttermilk and eggs. People are complainin’ that they can’t afford to pay as much as usual. I already cut my prices for a couple of women,” said Granddaddy, “They sounded so pathetic.”<br><br>“I hear rumors that the teachers may get a pay cut next year,” said Tump.<br><br>“At least we’ll be able to put food on the table,” said Grandma.<br><br>“Oh,” said Granddaddy, “Is Jake Dove still courtin’ Sary? I know he built that fishpond for her. He seems to have plenty of money.”<br><br>“Yeah,” said Tump, “I think he comes to see her about every Saturday night, but I don’t think anything will ever come of it.”<br><br>“Sary”, so called by most everyone was Sarah Wells, a first cousin to Momma. The fishpond was fed by a fine, cool spring and dammed by a masonry wall. It was a beautiful piece of work and I suppose the pond was stocked with fish. Sary had a huge early transparent apple tree in her side yard. The tree was so tall that it was hard to get an apple to eat. They were all out of reach and the ones that fell were smashed to pulp when they hit the ground. She had a cow and Momma sent me to fetch milk before they moved away.<br><br>My uncles got back from town after a while. “Any news from town?” somebody asked.<br><br>“Not much,” said Uncle Kyle. “Joe Wampler from Crackers Neck was laid off from his job, but he didn’t have any seniority.”<br><br>“Dang depression! Shit!” said Granddaddy. So it went. It was hard to be optimistic in those days. He stayed silent for a while and continued with, ”Fix my bed Tave.”<br><br>Everyone heard Granddaddy’s signal. I think I noticed stretching and yawning around the room. It was well to keep peace in the family and everyone soon began to get ready for bed. The last one to bed blew out the lamps and said, ”Good night.” So passed a typical evening at Grandma’s.	1	2017-04-21 22:43:18.630608	2017-04-23 00:12:21.384677	2007	1	\N	\N	\N	1167	\N	\N
59	Preston	It would be a century before anyone would make a call on his cellular telephone or play a video game. Nobody watched television, sent an E-mail message or used an I-pod. Nobody had to line up to be searched before boarding an airplane; there were no airplanes. There was not a shopping mall or a McDonald’s to be found in the Land. No need for them since automobiles were things of the future. Nevertheless, nearly every family had a horse and a wagon since most in southwestern Virginia where Preston lived were farmers. Children who were old enough helped with the farm work. They were allowed to go to school when the work slackened, so the school term was much shorter than it is now. Few kids went past eighth grade and very few were obese. By the way, they walked to school, played vigorous games at recess and brought their own lunches. The farms in the area were not big spreads as one might see in the flatlands, but patches of tilled bottomlands and the lower slopes of hillsides with some higher reaches cleared for pasture, so that the closest neighbor may have lived on the opposite side of a ridge. People living on these farms were thought of as poor, but they were rich, especially when compared with people in the rest of the world. They seldom went hungry and they were free to do as they pleased so long as they didn’t infringe on the rights of others.<br><br>Dusk caught up with Preston while he was enjoying a Sunday afternoon with friends. He had meant to be home by dark but there was no chance at this hour. He bade his friends farewell and headed home. Because of his good intentions he had no light for the road home, but it was to be a clear night and starlight would make the road plain. The road followed a meandering creek most of the way home.<br><br>“Hmm, I could cut a mile off this trip if I go through the woods. The path starts right yonder,” he told himself. He’d walked the path before, but never at night, but this young dude was feeling brave and forged ahead.<br><br>The path was seldom used and here and there a briar or a shrub overhung it. Preston moved up the path without much trouble, although it did seem a little darker than he had anticipated. His feet got tangled in a briar once but it didn’t trip him. As he drew closer to home the foliage of the trees became denser and starlight dimmed on the path. This slowed his pace to little more than that of a snail. He found himself needing to feel his way along the path by the shrubs alongside. By this time he heard sounds in the woods as something creeping through the fallen leaves, but he couldn’t tell if it were coming or going. When he stopped to listen the sound stopped. He went on and the sound came back. He stopped and so did the sound. Then he noticed a tug at his foot when he moved it and found he had been dragging a briar from his previous entanglement. With a sigh he freed himself from the briar and continued on. An occasional break in the canopy of trees showed the path by starlight.<br><br>Suddenly young Preston’s heart jumped up into his throat. The hair on his neck stood at attention. His bravery vanished; he stood frozen in his tracks. His breathing became silent for fear of being detected. He was sure that the thing he saw just ahead was watching him by the light it emitted. Its whole body glowed in the darkness and it was bigger than Preston. He stared at the glow and he saw it staring back at him. He stood motionless for a long moment, considering what to do. He finally realized his path was rocky. He ever so slowly squatted toward the ground and feeling around grasped a rock bigger than his fist. As he cautiously rose to his feet he reckoned his next move to be to ease on by the thing. Maybe it wouldn’t notice him, but if it did he would crush its head with the rock, provided that he could find the head. He tiptoed toward his nemesis very gingerly, his heart throbbing. Never taking his eyes off the thing, he moved on up the path, holding his rock ready to strike. It never made a move and he noticed it was not in the path at all, but a good way off to the side. It would have to charge to attack him. He breathed a little easier as he went past and hurried down the path. The glowing thing did not follow, and he breathed a sigh of relief. When he got home and related his horror story he was rewarded with howling laughter. Then he was told what he had seen was nothing but foxfire, a phosphorescent fungus growing in dead wood.<br><br>Preston Wells was a great storyteller who loved to tell stories, especially about Preston. He was also my great uncle, one of the few I ever met. I was five or six years old and don’t remember many of his tales. I do remember him telling ghost stories. There was one about him being awakened one night, sitting up in bed and seeing a dead relative at the foot of the bed and talking with him. I recall his claim of inventing the knuckle coupler for railroad cars. He had applied for a patent and was waiting for the patent to be issued. His description of the device described exactly the couplers used on modern railroad cars. He implied that once the patent was issued, the whole clan would become rich. I never found out what happened but nobody ever saw the money. Did another inventor beat him to the filing of a claim, or was it just a dream or a tall tale?<br><br>On one of his visits Uncle Preston was playing around with the kid (me) who happened to be eating a piece of bread with apple butter. I think he was teasing me and I threatened his moustache with apple butter.<br><br>“If you rub apple butter in my moustache I won’t get you a pony,” were his words. He was referring to his talk about getting a pony for me, but I had been skeptical all along. The apple butter made its way to the moustache. I never got a pony. Despite all his tall tales, I finally heard the unadulterated truth from Uncle Preston.<br><br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:03:54.139051	2017-04-23 00:12:21.391489	2007	1	\N	\N	\N	1137	\N	\N
55	Granny	My bride agreed to marry me because she wanted a man who was taller than she was. I wanted a good mother in law. Maybe we each had other reasons, but we admitted to these.<br><br>The woman who was to become my mother in law was tolerant of me from the first, yes even kind. I expected that she would continue, so long as I treated her with respect. Bess M. Werff of Lima, Ohio, a widow, was a woman due respect by all who knew her. She had no middle name, so she chose a middle initial no doubt to match her maiden name, McCreary. I called her Bessie, after I married her daughter, of course.<br><br>Bessie was of slight stature, about five feet, two inches, and somewhat squarely built. Her gray hair was cut to a medium length, just below the ear lobe. Rounded cheeks broadened her face. Through her glasses, her eyes hinted at a smile, giving her a pleasant appearance.<br><br>Bessie wore a hearing aid for as long as I knew her. Conversations with her were best limited to small groups, for many voices in close proximity became garbled. Her early hearing aids were bulky contraptions with batteries, microphone, and amplifier, packaged together and worn under her clothing. Connected to the package by a cord was the actual hearing device, mounted behind her ear to conduct sound through the bone. Over the years, hearing aids were made smaller, for which she was truly grateful.<br><br>Bessie lived just outside of town in a modest two-story house where she grew up. Located on a five-acre plot, the house shared tillable land and a small apple orchard, small that is, until apple picking time. Her Early Transparent apples were a mid-summer delight from which she made the best applesauce a body ever ate. The bulk of the orchard was devoted to Jonathan, a general purpose variety, ripening in the fall.<br><br>I ate tomatoes and summer squash from the vegetable garden she enjoyed tilling. Her real outdoor joy was embodied in her flower garden where she raised gladiolas, larkspur, cosmos, baby’s breath and many other varieties of posies. Picture if you will a little old lady, shaded by a wide brimmed not-so-new straw hat, and dressed in an old brown, calf-length dress, wielding a hoe and pulling weeds from among her flowers. This was Bessie having fun.<br><br>The good mother in law loved her family. She had her son, two daughters and their broods in for Thanksgiving Day dinner for as long as she was able. My four children liked her so much that they insisted she spend Christmas Eve with us each year. I believe that they were glad to see their parents leave just so their granny could stay with them.<br><br>She took a job at Jack’s Cafeteria, where she worked for ten years or more. A few years after all her children had married and left her, Bessie found her old home more than she could manage alone and moved to an apartment in town. This was a good move for her. It was more convenient for her son, Bob, to look in on her and to take her to Church each Sunday.<br><br>This was a woman firm in her beliefs. Many a time I challenged a statement she made and we argued the point until we got tired of the game. It was all just in fun; we neither ever conceded to the other.<br><br>Bessie was a spunky woman. She was walking on a downtown street alone when a purse-snatcher came up behind her and did his dirty deed. I’ll bet he was one surprised dude when his mark caught up with him and snatched it back from him. Foiled, he quickly fled from her sight.<br><br>Bessie was always ready to help wherever she could, be it teaching a Sunday School class, being a granny, or a friend. She was a Christian and yes, a pretty good mother in law.	1	2017-04-21 22:44:58.02338	2017-04-23 00:12:21.398063	2007	2	\N	\N	\N	687	\N	\N
92	Electra	We arrived at the Dayton airport after an hour drive down Interstate 75. I was with Jimmy Dell of our sales department to visit a customer to work out final details of an electric power system that we were manufacturing for them. Air travel was fairly new for me although I had been on flights before. But still, takeoff was always a white-knuckle event for me.<br><br>I had made numerous trips for Westinghouse, mostly by train. I had ridden trains since early childhood and enjoyed it. It seemed quite natural to take a train. After all Lima had five railroads, four offering passenger service. It was convenient to board a train and not worry about airports or traffic until I was at my destination. I had only to sit and relax until I got sleepy and then get into my berth for a good nap. I slept in the belly of this monstrous serpent as it raced across the plains of Ohio before making its way through the Allegany Mountains. At times the great beast could see its tail following far behind as it rounded a curve. I awoke in plenty of time for breakfast in the dining car. It was a short cab ride to my business meeting that took most of the day. Then I was ready to retrace my steps and board the overnight train back to home.<br><br>Things were changing and I was part of the reason. I designed control and protection equipment for the electric power systems used in airplanes. Why should I be stressed by takeoff? I don’t know; but here we were waiting to board a plane.<br><br>“They’re ready for us to board our flight,” Jimmy said, “We’re flying a brand new airplane, a Lockheed Electra.”<br><br>“Electra,” I gulped, “Where’ve I heard that name before?”<br><br>“Oh, I don’t know, maybe in the newspaper.”<br><br>“Yeah, the paper. There was an airplane that fell out of the sky over Tell City, Indiana and crashed nearby. That was a Lockheed Electra. Happened just a few weeks ago. What caused the crash?”<br><br>“I don’t know if they’ve found out yet.”<br><br>“Let’s go back home,” I said.<br><br>No,” he said as he nudged me back into the line. Here was this convict being escorted to the chair.<br><br>After what seemed like a mile hike we found our seats on the plane, buckled our seat belts as instructed and were ready for takeoff. As ready as I could be. In due time we started down the runway. I guess I had extra white knuckles that day.<br><br>About half way through the takeoff a loud crack sounded in my ear. They wouldn’t even let me sit down for my execution; rather, it was the firing squad. I couldn’t find any blood. Once I realized that I was still alive I turned my head toward my seatmate and saw the devil laughing his fool head off.<br><br>“What’s so funny? Oh, the joke’s on me,” I said. Jimmy had lifted the lid of the ashtray once provided by the airlines as an accommodation to their smoking passengers (before the tobacco nazis got smoking banned), and he had slammed it closed with a startlingly loud report.<br><br>I tried to relax, but to no avail. We had made a successful takeoff but for the rest of the flight I was acutely aware of all changes in the noise that the plane made. I thought of the many parts of an airplane that needed to work properly for it to fly. Oh well, I consoled myself; another Tell City incident was highly unlikely.<br><br>I was much more at ease on our flight back home. The probable reason was that we returned on a plane that was not an Electra. I never heard of another crash involving an Electra. My white-knuckle syndrome finally subsided when I realized that the most dangerous part of an airline flight was the trip to and from the airport.	1	2017-04-22 16:56:04.193982	2017-04-23 00:12:21.442212	2009	5	\N	\N	\N	698	\N	\N
66	Stockings	World War II had been over only a short time when a union at Westinghouse staged a strike against the company. The war had affected everybody in material ways. Supporting the military caused shortages in many things people had taken for granted. Besides the big items, cars, major appliances and such, everyday stuff was rationed, for example coffee sugar, even shoes and of course, gasoline. Shortages of many items remained long after the war’s end. A line would form by the cigarette vending machine before the service man reached it to refill it. Wage and price controls were responsible for some shortages. Most companies had profited during the war and of course the unions wanted their share.<br><br>In anticipation of the strike the company rented space on the tenth floor of the National Bank building down town where they set up temporary offices for most of the salaried employees. The engineering department was located in a large meeting room with the draftsmen’s drawing boards located near the windows in the corner of the room for maximum light. The engineers’ desks were arranged in groups according to section, that is motor design, generator design or control systems design. We were a little cramped for space, but we made do. We couldn’t build any prototypes or test any of our equipment because the factory was shut down, so we had to concentrate on paper designs.&nbsp;<br><br>We may not have been very productive during the strike but working downtown had some personal advantages. There were several places to eat downtown that saved my having to eat lunch in the company cafeteria. It was convenient for shopping during lunch hour. There were no shopping malls and stores closed at 5:30 except for one night each week.&nbsp;<br><br>One day one of our stenographers looked down from our lofty perch and noticed a line of women in front of a lingerie shop. “Nylons!” she exclaimed and disappeared, followed by the rest of our girls headed for the elevator.<br><br>Nylons? Hm. Then I remembered that girls had been painting their legs with something the color of silk hose. Why? Of course, it wasn’t merely a new fad; new stockings had been scarce. My mind, then working like a steel trap snapping closed on its prey, gave me an idea. The girl I’d been dating had had trouble finding new hose. The next thing I knew I was standing in a line of women.<br><br>“What am I doing here? This is embarrassing, standing in line to go into a women’s underwear store. I hope nobody that knows sees me. Maybe I can look like I’m just with one of these gals. Why am I sweating? Oops, the line’s moving.” These and worse thoughts entered my steel-trap mind. Finally it was my turn. What size? Tall. Foot about this long, I showed the salesgirl, holding my hands about ten inches apart. I was let out of prison by paying the girl and leaving with my prize.<br><br>When next I saw Mary I hended her the hose, still in the store’s bag saying, “This is for you; hope you like it.”<br><br>“Thank you so much,” she said, “What’s the special occasion? It’s not my birthday or anything.”<br><br>“Any time I see you it’s a special occasion,” I said and she gave me a big kiss.<br><br>“You tall, handsome dude, you know how to wedge yourself into a girl’s heart,” she thought, if I read her mind correctly.&nbsp;<br><br>Sometimes things have a way of working out right.<br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:21:56.299937	2017-04-23 00:12:21.45821	2008	3	\N	\N	\N	625	\N	\N
93	Easter	The Sunday morning ritual had begun. Saturday night sleep came to an abrupt end when a young child gave voice to his discomfort, demanding attention. Everybody up! Dry diapers! Don’t be too slow with breakfast! We were off to a running start for the day. With the noisy baby quieted we could proceed with our own breakfast and other duties. Of course the process was far simpler when there was only one baby to attend to. By the time there were three it was a bit more difficult. Most of the burden fell to their mother Mary, of course. The kitchen became the bathroom. After the breakfast dishes were washed and put away, the kitchen table became a dressing table. With towels on the table and clothes in place nearby, we started making the babies ready for the trip to church. It was a sight to behold.<br><br>Having drawn warm water into the kitchen sink, Mary stripped David of his nightclothes and lifted him into the sink for the first bath. When she was finished with him she put him on the table where I dried him with a towel and helped him get dressed. Meanwhile, she had changed the water and put Stephen into the sink for bath number two and passed him on to me to dry etc. while she bathed Catherine. Somehow we managed to get everybody cleaned up and ready to go most Sundays. By the time we got Susanna we had moved to our new house and Mary changed the Sunday morning rat race. I don’t remember how but it worked.<br><br>In my early days as a family man, Easter became a very special Sunday for reasons in addition to the annual celebration of the Resurrection of Jesus. By the time our firstborn was a year old we had joined Market Street Presbyterian Church and decided that it was time to have him baptized. I don’t know how we came up with the date for the event but it turned out to be Easter, so on that day we presented him for baptism. Before the end of the year our second son was born and we had another candidate for baptism. We chose the next Easter as an appropriate date and Pastor Art Romig agreed. I believe pastors really enjoy baptizing babies. They are prone to carry the child down the aisle of the church to show him off to the congregation.<br><br>Before another year passed we were blessed by the birth of our first daughter. Easter came and Pastor Romig repeated the sacrament of baptism. I thought I sensed a murmur from the pews, “The Jessees again” but we were not done. We came back for the fourth consecutive Easter with our second daughter for baptism. This time I was sure I heard a murmur, “When are they going to stop.” Well, we did stop; that was the end of the line. We decided to keep them all.<br><br>As time went by, somebody (probably their mother) started spreading stories about a crazy rabbit that went around laying eggs on the eve of Easter. They called him the Easter Bunny. This was news to me for I’d never heard of such an absurd thing. I had been on Easter egg hunts when I was a child but I found only dyed hen eggs. They certainly did not come from rabbits; I knew that things rabbits left behind were much smaller than hen eggs. Nevertheless I went along with the myth. Kids seemed to enjoy being fooled.<br><br>When all the children were in school, but yet little, Mary made Easter outfits for all of them. She made jackets for the boys and matching dresses for the girls. Wow! Did they look snazzy that Easter! Mary had even made matching full-length coats and tam-o’-shanters for the dollies! Mothers seldom take the time and energy to do things like that these days. I have only one regret concerning those Easters and the years in between; they all passed much too quickly.	1	2017-04-22 16:56:32.681158	2017-04-23 00:12:21.471532	2008	3	\N	\N	\N	688	\N	\N
65	Storm Casualty	Barely a whisper of thunder slipped through the barrier of walls and windows of the house. A glance at the windows revealed a slight dimming of daylight, perhaps warning of a coming thundershower. Previous days had been dry despite the sound of distant thunder many miles away. The whisper became louder and the sky darker until the whisper was replaced by a shout.<br><br>“I believe I’ll go sit on the front porch,” I said. I enjoyed watching a thunderstorm from a sheltered spot.&nbsp;<br><br>“I’ll get a chair and join you,” said Cat as I pulled open the front door and stepped out. Before I got the door closed behind me Cat opened the back door to retrieve a folding chair to bring out front. At that instant a powerful gust of wind zipped through the house and closed the front door with a slam that jarred the front of the house. I was not quite ready for the closure. My attempt at holding the door from slamming shut was an exercise in futility. When I pulled my left hand from the door the end of the third finger was left behind.<br><br>The palm of my hand became a reservoir of blood as I made my way to the kitchen sink. Cat got an empty cottage cheese bucket and half filled it with ice and water.<br><br>“Put your hand in here. Don’t look at it. It looks like raw hamburger,” Cat said, as if the sight of it would make me retch.<br><br>After much excitement and a few more ice cubes we were off on a Sunday afternoon ride to a hospital emergency room; my hand in the bucket, while its contents took on a deeper red hue. The woman at the admitting desk inquired of my problem and asked to see it. I removed my hand from the bucket and thrust it toward her. She looked and dropped her doughnut. She had indicated a long line, but after her view of my finger and the bucket, I was put into the express line. There seemed to be some question of how to dispose of my bloody bucket.<br><br>The doctor on duty looked at the damage and said, “When did you have your last tetanus shot.<br><br>“1944,” I said. “I remember it well. I was in a line of Army privates headed toward a pair of medics, one on each side of the line. They both hit an arm at the same time. The typhoid shot stung immediately but I barely felt the tetanus shot – for a minute, that is. Before I could put my shirt back on it hit me like a Joe Louis knockout punch. The arm ached for the next two days and any movement only exacerbated the ache.”&nbsp;<br><br>I declined the kind doctor’s recommended shot. She suggested a plastic surgeon and we left with a new bulky bandage.<br><br>The next day the plastic surgeon looked at the wound showing little sympathy for a casualty of the thunderstorm.<br><br>“Where’s the skin that’s missing?” he asked.<br><br>“Don’t know. Stuck to the door frame, I suppose,” I said.<br><br>“Gross,” he grimaced. “I’ll have to take a piece of skin from your wrist to graft on the end of the finger.”<br><br>Before we left we had to make three more stops to answer the same set of questions as we had to do before seeing the doctor. One would think that in this age of instant worldwide communications a copy of the first set of answers could be sent to the other departments in the same building. Wonder why medical service is so expensive?<br><br>Back the next day, it seemed as if major surgery were about to take place. Someone ushered me to a room and bade me undress, don a hospital gown and get into bed. For the next hour a nurse was very kind to me despite sticking me with a needle attached to a bag of something or other. She spread a cover over me and installed something like leg warmers. She made me very comfortable.<br><br>The next thing I knew the nurse asked me how I felt. I noticed that the needle was gone. I sat up and she helped me out of bed. She instructed me to get dressed and then I could go. When I looked at my hand I saw a new big, bulky bandage on my finger. To add insult to injury, another bandage was taped across my wrist, as if to cover a suicide wound.<br><br>When, a day later, the doctor inspected his work he seemed satisfied, but when I saw it I was less so. It was the ugliest finger I could remember seeing. It had grown a ring of black whiskers, or maybe they were stitches.<br><br>Soak in soapy water, add ointment and change the bandage three times a day; that was the routine for the next two weeks. Then the stitches were removed. It’s still ugly but it looks better without the black whiskers. I do have something to be thankful for. It didn’t happen sixty years ago.<br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:21:21.512185	2017-04-23 00:12:21.478273	2008	7	\N	\N	\N	897	\N	\N
67	The Packard	“Come on in,” was the response to my knock on the door of Ruth and Bob Taylor, my wife Mary’s sister and brother in law.<br><br>“Haven’t seen you for a while. How’ve you been?” asked Mary.<br><br>“Fairly well,” Ruth said, and the conversation continued on into the afternoon, filling in each other on the latest happenings of potential interest.<br><br>An aroma filled the air teasing my appetite. I thought we should be moving on home soon, so as not to interfere with their suppertime. Bob came in and announced that his bean soup was done and that we should stay and sup with them. It smelled so good that no one could refuse the invitation. The expression on Bob’s face that sported a sharp nose slightly tending toward one side and penetrating, near-black eyes made it plain that the invitation was sincere.<br><br>“Mighty good bean soup,” I had to admit.<br><br>“Thanks. You have to simmer the pintos for a couple of hours with a big chunk of fat salt cured bacon. I like mine with a lot of raw onion sliced up in it. One of my favorite dishes,” Bob said as he applied a generous helping of good strong onion. He had made a large pot of bean soup, and a good thing, too, for after feeding his family and mine, I think there was little left over.<br><br>After supper I noticed a car with its rear end smashed sitting in front of his garage, and asked, “Did someone wreck your car?”<br><br>“No,” he said, “ I bought a wreck. Come on, I’ll show you.”<br><br>“You bought it? It looks in pretty bad shape to me,” I said in amazement.<br><br>“It’s a Packard,” he said. “I like to work on Packards. I’m looking for another one of the same model with the front end wrecked. I’ll use the front end of this one and the rear end of the other to make a good late model car.”<br><br>“Well, good luck,” I said skeptically. Bob was a mail carrier who liked to tinker with cars in his spare time. He told of odd things he did along his mail route, such as putting aside his mail pouch and helping an old lady get to her potty and back to her chair, among other things. He was a good-hearted soul.<br><br>Two or three months after our visit, a ruby-maroon colored car pulled into my driveway. Bob and Ruth got out and headed for the front door. They had come for a friendly visit. I noticed by the unique shape of its grill, that the car was a late model Packard.<br><br>“Hi folks. Looks like you got a new car.” I said.<br><br>“No,” Bob said, “It’s the one you saw when you were at our house a while back.”<br><br>“No kiddin’. I’ll be durned. What I saw was a wreck. You must have found the other wreck you had in mind,” I said.<br><br>“Yep, I found the same model one with the front end smashed. Got it cheap, too. It had all the good parts I needed to make a whole car. Gave it a paint job. Looks pretty decent, huh?” Bob said proudly.<br><br>“Looks great,” I said.<br><br>“I’ll drive it until I can sell it. Then I’ll find me another wreck to fix up.” Bob said.<br><br>“You’re goin’ to sell it?” I said.” Let me take it for a test drive.” He did and I did. It was indeed a very nice car. It was easy to drive and showed no signs of having been in a wreck.<br><br>It was near the end of the Packard era; in very few years the company was to be out of business. Packard had been a big name in luxury cars, but was competing with less expensive models. However Bob’s car was entirely adequate for my use. Besides that, I was overdue for getting rid of the old clunker I’d been driving.<br><br>After mulling it over for a few days, I made a deal with Bob and bought his car. We were both happy with the deal and he started looking for another wreck.<br><br>I drove the Packard for several years, to work, on occasional weekend trips, and vacation tours with little trouble.<br><br>One wet day I was taking the family somewhere in the car. Mary was in the front seat as usual and four little kids in back. Without warning Mary squealed and lifted her feet off the floor.<br><br>“What’s the matter, is there a mouse down there?” I said.<br><br>“No, my hose are getting wet.” She said.<br><br>“Oh nuts,” I said, “The spike heels on your shoes must have punched through the rusty floor. Use the rag in the glove compartment to plug the hole.”<br><br>I knew the end was nigh for the Packard. I guess the words yet unspoken by a fellow engineer at work, “Jess, you never own a car. You marry it,” were true, even then. Was I really a bigamist?<br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:22:53.716228	2017-04-23 00:12:21.494925	2008	4	\N	\N	\N	901	\N	\N
68	Hannah	Little theater was her number one hobby. She had other interests of course, such as genealogy and The Humane Society, but the theater stood out above all others. Dorothy had been a member of Amil Tellers for well over forty years. During her tenure she participated in nearly every aspect of the theater activities. She had acted, setup and painted scenery, produced and helped producers, assisted with costumes and makeup, ushered at many shows, reviewed scripts and did anything else that needed to be done around the theater.<br><br>She had many long-time friends made through the theater, and continued to make new friends among the newcomers. She kept doing her part around the theater for years, now and then getting a small part in a play, but she became dissatisfied because the plays selected for performance had few substantial parts for an older character, and competition was keen for such roles. What she really wanted was not a leading part in a play but a meaty role. Nevertheless she kept on assisting in production of play after play.<br><br>Eventually the selected play for late March needed a cast of women of all ages. A friend of Dorothy urged her to try out for the play. She was reluctant at first but finally agreed and went to the tryouts. I can’t adequately describe what happened as a result of the urging. I shall let Dorothy tell her story in her own words as written in letters to her family.<br><br>“What a wonderful Birthday I have had! It all started out in January of this year. I went down to tryouts for the show LADIES FIRST. Almost didn’t go down. I had made a copy of the script months before and studied some of the parts. Monday the 25th of January at 7:30 P.M. tryouts began. I sat in the front row of the auditorium. Read for the parts of Bess Truman. Mamie Eisenhower &amp; Hannah the Maid. Read for Hannah a couple of times. Didn’t get a chance to read for Eleanor Roosevelt. When I left the theatre that night I felt kinda discouraged. They (the ladies) said that I had given a good tryout but that isn’t always what gets you the part. Competition is keen and lots of factors enter into whether you’re cast or not. I went on home telling myself that I did my best and be happy with it. At eleven o’clock that night the telephone rang. It was George Dunster the director for the show. I was already prepared to accept the message that I didn’t get any part. I was wrong. He told that I had given a good reading and he wanted me to play the part of Hannah, the feisty White House Maid. He said that he considered me a nice person but he wanted me to play Hannah, the opposite way. George and I go back a long way as friends and working together on stage as actress and actor and director and actress. Consider yourself privileged to be in a show he directs. I was on Cloud 29 that night and had a hard time going to sleep. It has been 10 years since I’ve had a good supporting role. I thanked God that night for granting me by birthday wish and asked for his help to do a good performance when we gave the play in March. Not just for my own self esteem, but for George who believed in my ability and to God who answered the prayer and let it be his will that I get the part and to the audience that I would be playing to for their entertainment. When you perform on stage you give a gift of yourself in playing a character to the people who pay good money to see your show. It is a good feeling to know that you did your best and have pleased the audience at the same time….<br><br>“To sum it up: We had a great time with a good show. Was directed by My favorite director, good production crew and a fabulous set to give Our show. My sister was so impressed with the play that she wants it to be given by the Fort Findlay Theater Group. It is just a well-written Script and the audience enjoyed it.<br><br>Wow, what a birthday!<br><br>Dorothy (Hannah)”<br><br>EPILOG: Like Cinderella, Dorothy did the dog work for the family, and wanted something better. Her friend Alice was the fairy godmother who sent her to the ball (tryouts). Maybe her doubts were the lost slipper, found in the director’s notes that led to the real prize.<br><br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:23:47.585444	2017-04-23 00:12:21.501586	2008	7	\N	\N	\N	804	\N	\N
94	Dog Done	Half asleep I made my way to the kitchen for my eye-opener cup of joe. My quarters are separated from the main part of the house by a small porch where the dog usually sleeps. I noticed that he was not there, but there is a large back yard for him to roam in and thought no more about it. My trip for a second cup was the same. Catherine had left early to help with a garage sale for the Sweet Adelines, her singing sisters. With my eyes unglued I fixed myself a modest breakfast of toast slathered with a generous layer of cream cheese, hoping it would substitute for my usual eggs. After breakfast I still didn’t see the dog. Sometimes he lay at a door at the side of the house, so I checked there and noticed the gate was open, but no dog was in sight. I didn’t know why the gate was open but I guessed he was exploring the neighborhood and would return shortly. I expected Catherine to stop by the house on her way to work but she didn’t so I called her workplace.<br><br>“Hello. Earthly Treasures,” a sweet voice responded.<br><br>“Hi, my Treasure.”<br><br>“Oh, hello Daddyo, did you get your breakfast?”<br><br>“I did. I thought I should report that your dog’s gone. I haven’t seen him today and I found the gate open. He was here last night when I gave him his supper.”<br><br>“I’m going to put a note on the door and come and look for him. Gloria is coming in at noon.”<br><br>She arrived home shortly through the open gate asking, “Why is the gate open so wide?”<br><br>“No idea why it’s open at all.”<br><br>Catherine got out her bicycle and optimistically a leash to tour the neighborhood. She soon came back and took her car for a wider look. She handed out cards with her name and phone number to those she met. Someone she saw suggested that that somebody saw him out loose and may have picked him up. She came back empty-handed.<br><br>The dog she was looking for, called Foxy or Buddy, is a Sheltie, bred to corral sheep. He loves to run. When he’s glad to see someone he runs in tiny circles; he becomes a spinning top. He’s a pretty little dog and very friendly toward everyone and loves being petted. He had been with us for about four months and we’re very fond of him despite his strange habit of trying to chase away the monster that has the voice of thunder. He races with his tail raised as a flag from corner to corner of the yard in full voice in competition with the voice of the monster.<br><br>While Catherine was gone I inspected the open gate. It was open wide enough that a horse could easily walk through. I also noticed that a cinder block was moved to a position that interfered with the gate being closed. Ah, I was sure the dog had been stolen. In my mind I could see a thief luring the dog out through the open gate. What dog could resist a hand holding a piece of fresh meat?<br><br>“No dog?” I asked as she returned empty handed.<br><br>“I gave everyone I met my card with my cell phone number in case someone sees him.”<br><br>“I think he was stolen,” I said. Catherine tended to agree but didn’t want to believe it. She got on her computer and alerted all those she could think of. That kept her busy for the afternoon. She spent the evening making posters with a color picture of the dog headed by LOST DOG and her phone number at the bottom.<br><br>She was up early Sunday morning posting the notices on parking lot stop signs, on church windows and in the neighborhood from which she’d had a Saturday call from a woman claiming to have seen the dog in her yard.<br><br>We had a late breakfast, intending to go to church soon when the phone rang. Catherine answered. A woman’s voice said, “I’ve got your dog.” Catherine nearly fell out of her chair. The call came from just across the street from us, a small church where one of the notices had been posted an hour before.<br><br>We went to the church where we met Lacy who told us the dog was at her home with her own two dogs. After her church service was done we went to Lacy’s house in the same neighborhood as the Saturday caller’s, and met Foxy who seemed to be enjoying his visit immensely.<br><br>“I woke up at about four o’clock Saturday morning and couldn’t go back to sleep,” said Lacy who was pregnant, “so I went to the Exxon station to get something and saw your dog there looking lost. A man was there and wanted to take him home as his own. The dog came to me and I told the man that I would take the dog and find his owner. So I brought him home with me. My boys have enjoyed playing with him.”<br><br>“Thank you oh so much. I really appreciate your help,” said Catherine when we finally headed home.<br><br>It’s amazing how much territory a dog can explore in a few hours. Foxy was lucky to have chosen the middle of the night to travel a mile from home. He crossed two major streets when traffic was minimum.<br><br>Catherine spent the rest of Sunday retrieving the twenty-odd posters she had spent most of the morning posting. I was glad that I was wrong about the stealing thought. With the dog safely home we were able to relax from two stressful days. A mystery remains however; how in the world did the dog get that gate open.	1	2017-04-22 16:57:19.24782	2017-04-23 00:12:21.50831	2009	7	\N	\N	\N	1026	\N	\N
97	Going Green	Green is the name of a color. It describes the most obvious commonality among nearly all growing plants. This is something I learned even before I went to school. In school I had a green crayon. Later I learned that it was next to impossible to start a campfire with green wood and that I was a greenhorn at most anything I tried for the first time. Sometime in my youth I learned that those beautiful plants could not survive without carbon dioxide.<br><br>It was discovered that the planet Venus has lots of carbon dioxide, so much that it traps heat that keeps the planer hot. They call it the greenhouse effect. Some so called scientist took note of this and figured that Earth would go the way of Venus if we continued to burn gas, oil and coal. He somehow spread this idea around until a lot of folks agreed with his propaganda.<br><br>At some bygone time Al Gore, “inventor of the internet”, joined ranks with the tree huggers. I believe he looked at them and saw dollar signs floating all around. If he worked it right he could make a mint of money. All he needed to do was to convince enough people that his kooky ideas were right. With no evidence and plenty of help from environmentalist buddies he proclaimed that the earth was warming; and that it was all caused by human beings, particularly Americans. Thus we who drive more cars than the rest of the world must be responsible for melting glaciers and rising oceans. We must be causing deserts to form. Asia pollutes the earth far more than does the United States, but we are the cause of global warming. This is a giant hoax.<br><br>Actually the earth has been cooling for the past ten years, despite more carbon dioxide in the air. Ever more scientists say the globe is in a cooling trend. So what do Al Gore and his ilk say after all the ballyhoo about global warming? Give it a different name, say climate change; but still blame it on our burning of fossil fuels. How can carbon dioxide cause both warming and cooling? The climate has been changing ever since there has been a climate. Could it be that the sun has something to do with climate? There are always storms raging on the sun; but nobody would believe that we dirty humans could influence the sun an iota.<br><br>What does all this have to do with “green”? I believe that green is a buzzword that pertains to carbon. “Carbon footprint” is a term tossed around like a football. Any business that uses energy derived from carbon fuel is deemed to have a carbon footprint. The more fuel used, the bigger the footprint, and thus more destructive to the planet. The big prints, according to the powers that be, must be punished.<br><br>As I see it, going green is a defensive play. It is designed to give the perception of saving energy whether it does or not. An electric car will use no gasoline, but will it use less energy is in question. Car makers are forced to make little, less safe cars in the name of going green. It seems to be good business to sell “green” products to believers. Even those who need to communicate with their customers are going green via the internet whether or not it is convenient for the customers. There is no thought of saving the planet; it’s just cheaper.<br><br>All this talk about saving the planet is not about saving the planet; it’s all about power and money. Anyone who has heard about “cap and tax (excuse me, trade)” should have no doubt about it. Certainly Gore has made his millions, with more to come.<br><br>I certainly don’t believe in wasting the world’s resources. It makes perfect sense however to make use of God’s gifts to mankind. I suppose going green is all right if it’s for the right reasons. Fortunately fewer people are being fooled by the hoax that climate change is a manmade thing.	1	2017-04-22 17:01:16.069768	2017-04-23 00:12:21.534417	2009	8	\N	\N	\N	703	\N	\N
98	Odd Odds and Ends	“Pile into the car kids, we’re goin’ to Squirty’s, said Dad. Bill and I climbed into the back seat and waited for Mom and Dad. It was a Sunday afternoon and Uncle Don would probably be listening to his favorite classical music. It may seem a bit odd because few people do that; but it seemed to be one of the joys of his life. When we arrived we were greeted by the sound of music but Uncle Don didn’t let it interfere with a nice visit. This was just one of many times we made such a trip and I was always impressed by the music. If I should ask him about it, I wonder what he would say.<br><br>“Well, Rebecca, I grew up in a small town. Most of the music I heard was from the radio – country music, Grand Ole Opry and the like. I was a young teen-ager when I went to the Mountain Laurel Festival pageant where a symphony orchestra played. I listened and fell in love with the orchestra and its music. After that I went to a concert every time I got a chance. When I could afford it I got a hi-fi music system and LPs that I loved to listen to. Quirky? Maybe, but what would you say to this? When your Aunt Mary was a five-foot-nine grown woman with four kids her siblings still called her Squirty. Now that’s quirky.”<br><br>I remember that Aunt Mary’s family had exotic pets in their house, but no common pets like dogs or cats. We had Homer the dog and I guess I didn’t understand why they didn’t have a dog. As I recall Uncle Don didn’t like cats at all.<br><br>“OK, Rebecca, you’re right; I didn’t like cats. In my upbringing we never let animals live in the house with us. Their place was outdoors. When I was but a wee boy we had a cat that was let inside sometimes, but was always put out at night. One night we forgot to put him out. The next morning I went to put on my shoe and it was wet. Why? The cat peed in it. Also, after that I saw cats stalking fledging birds just for the sport of it. I enjoyed having birds in my back yard, and I put feed out for them. I couldn’t have cats sneaking around my bird feeders. I must admit that I once suggested to the little boy next door that he put his kitten in a bag with a rock and drop it in a pond. I really didn’t mean it. It was much later that I learned that cats could live indoors in harmony with people. That way the birds were relatively safe. I even began to like cats and even had some of my own, thanks to my latter wives. Correction: A person does not own a cat; it’s the other way around.<br><br>“When my kids were older one or more of them got the bright idea that I needed a dog and presented me with a pup which I was obliged to keep in the house. He was a cute little fellow, but I couldn’t break him of his chewing habit. I named him Amos. Later on I decided that Amos should be his middle name and his first should be Igner. The naming probably came about after he nearly drowned himself trying to grab a stream of water pouring from a hose I was using. Fortunately we found a young boy who longed for a dog and whose parents agreed to his longing. Nobody mentioned Amos’s first name. Amos had a new home. Evidently it was a much better home. The boy had his own room with twin beds, one of which Igner, I mean Amos, inherited. Later on I owned a dog that I really liked named Dinah.<br><br>"Perhaps you’ll consider it quirky that my kids had odd little pets; I do. I never knew exactly how they became part of the family. There was a succession of parakeets, a hamster or more, goldfish, numerous turtles, and maybe tadpoles in the bathtub and it’s hard to remember what else. Oh yes, I must mention the garter snake that somebody brought home from the park. I had to make a cage for it. It was a girl snake as we found out when in late summer we spied a dozen babies in the cage. Quirky? The kids even got their grandma in on their quirkiness by getting her a finch she called Harry, and a cage to keep him in.”<br><br>Returning home after a visit to aunt Mary’s, I noticed a few things that might look odd to her: pieces of wrecked automobiles in the yard, soup beans and raw onions for supper, and a few other things that I choose not to mention. I guess everybody has things that seem odd to other folks.	1	2017-04-22 17:02:08.105485	2017-04-23 00:12:21.541328	2009	3	\N	\N	\N	855	\N	\N
99	Pot o' Gold	“It’s quit rainin’ and the sun’s out again, but look at the sky. There’s a rainbow. Sure is pretty,” I said to Tump, my favorite aunt, “How can there be a rainbow when it’s not rainin’?”<br><br>“”Oh, it’s still rainin’ somewhere over yonder. It takes both sunshine and rain to make a rainbow,” Tump said. “By the way, they say there’s a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow”.<br><br>“Like a buried treasure?”<br><br>“Somethin’ like that.”<br><br>“We learned in Sunday School that a rainbow is a sign from God to Noah that the world would never be destroyed again by a flood. Maybe Noah found the pot of gold.”<br><br>“No, I don’t think so. I recon he would have been too busy unloading all those animals off the ark.”<br><br>“Why don’t we go over there and find it? The end of the rainbow is just over there on that ridge.”<br><br>“It’s a long walk over to the ridge. Then we’d have to climb the hill. I think the rainbow would be gone before we got there. Then we’d have to walk back.”<br><br>“OK,” I said, “Maybe the end of the next one will be closer, like in the front yard.” What did I know? I still believed in Santa Claus, as do too many grown-up people today, only Santa’s new name is government.<br><br>I saw lots of rainbows as I grew older. Some were bold and brilliant. Some were faint and barely visible and ending high in the sky. Those I liked best were those displaying ribbons of all of their possible colors and spanning the sky as an arched bridge over a gentle stream of water. Such a rainbow seemed to be anchored to the ground at both ends. But wait a minute! “They” say “a pot of gold”, but at which end? Did “they” really mean both ends? That would require two pots. Oh well, it’s too far to go to find either end.<br><br>Of all the rainbows I ever saw, not one has shown its end nearby, particularly near my yard. I finally realized that both ends of every rainbow that I saw were the same distance from me. I was in the middle of it. A man standing at the point that I saw as the end looked up and saw that he also saw the rainbow from a point midway between the ends. So where was the end? It could be only in the eye of the observer; thus there was no real end and no pot of gold.<br><br>AFTERWORD: I thought of writing about “I’m from the government, and I’m here to help you.” On the outside chance that one of our millions might testify to getting help, even though being from another planet, I chose the gold and rainbow myth.	1	2017-04-22 17:02:58.74221	2017-04-23 00:12:21.554318	2009	7	\N	\N	\N	506	\N	\N
95	High School Initiation	May 1935:<br><br>Another school year had ended but this one was different for me. I was no longer a junior high school student. I had graduated. It was all over except for the ceremony. I never figured out why, but the eighth grade class had to assemble for a final hurrah. We had to dress up and go to a graduation exercise. We all got a certificate saying that we had finished eighth grade. A report card had been enough before that.<br><br>A tradition existed that I had hardly noticed before. I was soon reminded however. The high school boys had a tradition of initiating the new boys into high school with a brand new haircut. No sooner than the ceremony was over than some big guys with their clippers were busy with their first victims. There was no such welcome for the girls. I stayed close to my parents all the way home thus avoiding being a victim myself.<br><br>A day later:<br><br>I got up, washed and combed my substantial shock of hair and tended my business as usual for a day off from school. I actually forgot about the boys who got trimmed last night. Early in the afternoon I walked to the football field where there were bound to be some guys playing touch football or some game I could join. As I expected, I saw familiar faces of schoolmates and a couple of bald heads I didn’t recognize at first glance. I finally recognized the faces of recent eighth graders that the lack of hair camouflaged.<br><br>“Looks like the guys with the clippers caught you two,” I said when they came within earshot.<br><br>“Yeah, they did such a bad job we had to get it all cut off. You should have seen us before that,” Paul answered. I joined the game for a while but I didn’t do very well. I kept watching for the guy with the clippers.<br><br>Two days passed:<br><br>On my way to the grocery story to get something for Mom I ran into Charlie. He had the weirdest haircut that I had ever seen. He had a clipper-wide swath of stubble from the middle of his forehead to the back of his head. That wasn’t all. There was a second swath running from his left ear to his right.<br><br>“Looks like they caught you, Charlie,” I said.<br><br>“Yeah, they snuk up on me when I wasn’t lookin’. I’m on the way to a barber right now,” he said.<br><br>Returning home with my groceries I met Bill who had a Mohawk style hairdo.<br><br>“I just saw Charlie back there. He looked a lot worse than you do,” I said.<br><br>“They got me when I wasn’t looking. But I kinda like it this way. I may just leave it be for a while,” said Bill. The rest of the way home I kept a sharp eye out for high school boys who might have hair clippers in a pocket.<br><br>A week later:<br><br>I hadn’t seen any new haircuts for a while, but I kept watching for the “barbers” to appear. No sign of anyone suspicious made me relax a little then I spotted a couple of high school boys just down the street. I made a quick about face and headed in the opposite direction. And so the day went.<br><br>Early June 1935:<br><br>It had been several days since I had seen any evidence of new activity by the hair cutters. They must have called off the search, so I let down my guard and headed toward the football field. As I turned a corner I came face to face with the guy who carried the clippers. Before I could turn to escape, somebody grabbed me from behind, pinning my arms down. This was it. To struggle would have meant a lot of hair pulling to no avail. Since I submitted peacefully they were gentle and didn’t try to scalp me, just chopped it up a bit and welcomed me to high school. Back home that night my family had a hearty laugh at my appearance. Daddy took a coin from his pocket and said, “Here’s a quarter. Go see what the barber can do to make you look human again.”<br><br>September 1935:<br><br>Our class as freshmen looked much as it had in the spring except that most of the boys had somewhat shorter hair. But wait! Jimmie and Jack, the one with the beautiful red hair, had strange haircuts. Must have gone to a bad barber. No, I think the bad barber came to them as they came back to school. Then I realized that I was glad I got caught early in the summer so that I looked according to Daddy, “human again”.	1	2017-04-22 16:58:19.769104	2017-04-23 00:12:21.514958	2009	2	\N	\N	\N	838	\N	\N
71	In Awe of Nature's Beauty	Visualize this: The night has been cold and crisp. A super cooled mist has wafted in on a gentle breeze and sunrise is at hand. A thin cloud cover blocks the view of the rising sun but presents a bright gray sky. The world has a ghostly appearance. Frost covers everything in sight. This is no ordinary frost. This is hoarfrost, the kind that is built of billions of tiny icicles that cling to every naked branch and twig in the slumbering woods beside the road. The thin clouds dissipate as the sun climbs into the sky. Slivers of sunlight filter through the trees transforming the ghostly forest into a brilliant display of all the world’s diamonds that emit a myriad of colors through tiny prisms. What could be more spectacular?<br><br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:27:23.831716	2017-04-23 00:12:21.521426	2008	7	\N	\N	\N	135	\N	\N
100	Physical Challenge	Asked to describe the most physically challenging task I ever completed, I thought back over a lifetime to see what I could remember. A few things came to mind but I had a hard time picking the most challenging.<br><br>As a Boy Scout working on the life-saving merit badge, I found the toughest requirement was to retrieve a ten-pound rock in a sack from the bottom of an eight-foot deep pool and return it to shore without drowning myself. For a skinny, fourteen year old kid who’d sink to the bottom with his lungs inflated this was a major challenge.<br><br>In a high school football game my assignment in the line was to take a guard out of the play. I thought it a fair task until the teams lined up for the play. My opponent outweighed me by at least forty pounds. Most of the forty pounds was fat but that was hard to move aside when he was coming straight at me. It helped that at least I was a little faster than he. In those days the team played both offense and defense, so there was no resting time when the ball changed hands so my challenge remained for the whole game.<br><br>A challenge I remember vividly happened on a hot day in August. It might be called a day in the hay. It was a day that no matter how many hours it lasted it was an eternity. One man rode a tractor up and down the field pulling a hay rake and leaving rows of dry hay to be hauled to the barn. Then there were we peons with pitchforks following while loading hay onto a wagon. The work was easy when the wagon was nearly empty but once it was nearly full it was hell. The fork full of hay had to be hoisted high above our heads and the breeze always blew into our faces depositing chaff down our backs. It got under our shirts and stuck to sweat like barnacles to a ship. Once full, a second wagon arrived on the scene for more. Never has a cool shower been more welcome than after that challenge.<br><br>I could mention other tasks such as digging through four-foot snow drifts on a minus ten degree morning to get my car out of the garage, but a more recent task has been a much greater physical challenge. I once got a daily newspaper, mostly for the comics and the crossword puzzles I think. I used to love to tend my garden when I could tell a weed from my plantings. I longed to hike mountain trails and see the panorama across valleys. I enjoyed driving my car especially on little traveled roads new to me. Stage productions, once a delight, appear as shadows moving on stage. My most physically challenging task is coping with my loss of sight.<br><br>I’ve never been a very orderly person, a trait I’m working on but have a long way to go. It’s easy to lose things that are out of place. I have trouble recognizing people and it’s embarrassing to ask their names time after time.<br><br>Nevertheless I have many reasons to be thankful. I see a splash of red outside. If I go out to have a close look I can see the shape of the color, big blossoms of amaryllis. I can hear the songs of birds. I can read recorded books provided by the library. I car enjoy the music of an orchestra even though I can’t see the players. Most importantly, people are generally helpful.<br><br>Of tasks that I have completed, which was the most physically challenging, I don’t really know. I believe my most physically challenging task is not complete, but I’m still working on it, and thankful for all the help I get.	1	2017-04-22 17:03:54.981641	2017-04-23 00:12:21.561151	2009	3	\N	\N	\N	662	\N	\N
101	Outfit	As a new hire as a student engineer of Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company I traveled to Pittsburgh for the job. I had borrowed more money from Daddy to tide me over until my first payday. I hoped to save some money from each check until I had enough to soon buy myself some new duds. Those I owned had served me since my high school days. I became especially aware of the thinness of the seat of the pants of my only suit when one day I saw the shape of my hand through the trousers seat. In a second observation I discovered that one could tell the color of my shorts when I wore the pants. I realized that I didn’t have long to save the money.<br><br>I was on the engineers’ minimum wage list at ninety cents an hour, almost double anything I had made at any previous job I’d had, but Daddy had paid for my food and lodging. Now with room and board bills to pay saving became more difficult. Besides that, my laundry bill really grew. In those days Pittsburgh, the steel capital of the world, had many sources of grime. Everybody burned coal. The first job each morning was to wipe up the black filth off of my desk; even so my shirtsleeves were a deep gray by quitting time. Several months passed before I had the wherewithal to afford to replace my old suit. Daddy had taught me to avoid debt.<br><br>When the big day came that I had the money I headed down town with a fellow boarder, Archie Todd as I remember. We went to a store that he knew, to look for a suit. Archie was an old hand at this sort of thing. We didn’t go to a cheap place. The clerk showed me several suits, among them a double breasted model, blue and all wool but the buttons. I tried it on for fit and looked at myself in the mirror. I thought I looked better than usual. I was a bit skeptical about the double breasted feature but Archie assured me that the style was in and not likely to go away. I hoped that he was right about that because I intended to wear it for a long time. With a tie and a couple of shirts I was broke until next payday. I was happy with my purchase. I now had a decent outfit that remained so for a long time. I never wore it out. I gave it to the Encore Theater as a period costume long after it was out of style.<br><br>But for all my pride and satisfaction with my first suit paid for with my own money, on reflection it was another outfit that I was most proud to wear. As a member of Boy Scouts of America I went to Scout meetings in my regular clothes for my first year or two. The uniform was simple, kaki shorts and shirt, neckerchief and to round it out an official hat. The shirt provided a place to display my troop number, my badge of rank and appropriate patches. It may have been a second hand outfit for all I recall but it didn’t matter. I was one of the real Boy Scouts, as anyone could see.	1	2017-04-22 17:04:41.479697	2017-04-23 00:12:21.567752	2009	2	\N	\N	\N	565	\N	\N
70	Bridge anyone?	“Martha Barnhart invited us to their house Saturday night to play Bridge,” Mary told me when I got home. “There’ll be two other couples, enough for two tables.”<br><br>“Sounds OK to me, we enjoy the game.” I said.<br><br>The Barnharts, parents of two daughters, were a friendly couple that we had known for a good while. Scott was a tall, good-looking mechanical engineer at my work place. We were never close associates, so this seemed an opportunity to get better acquainted. They lived a block away from our house; in fact we could see their place from our front window.<br><br>A long-lashed, blue eyed woman of medium build with brown, wavy hair, Martha walked with a severe limp as the result of a car wreck at one time that left her with one leg shorter than normal by a couple inches. Despite her handicap she seemed to function well.<br><br>Mary and I arrived at the Barnhart’s house at the appointed hour. Bob and Sue were already there, and Don and Betty followed us in. Martha, the genteel hostess, introduced us all and made us feel at ease. We had not met the other visiting couples before and we spent a few minutes getting acquainted before beginning the games.<br><br>We all sat at the two tables that were set up for the games. Spouses played as partners. After we played about eight hands we recorded our scores and each partnership played the next set of hands against a different pair; then we changed seats once more for the last hands, so that each couple played against each other couple. It all went very well so far as I could tell. I don’t know whether some couples went home at odds with each other because the partner didn’t play as expected, but such things sometimes do happen.<br><br>After the games and the scores were totaled, the hostess served a small snack, during which Martha made a proposal.<br><br>“It’s been fun for me,” she said, and everyone else agreed that they’d had a pleasant time. Then she continued, “I propose that we play every month. We can take turns hosting the games.” After a little discussion we agreed.<br><br>“We’ll volunteer for next month,” Mary said, and so it came to pass that a little Bridge club was formed.<br><br>“Sorry to be late,” Martha said, when a month later three couples had sat waiting for fifteen or twenty minutes. “We had to go get a baby-sitter.”<br><br>“That’s OK, sometimes things happen. Lets play bridge,” Mary said. Soon the games got underway, and everyone had a good time, as before.<br><br>The situation was similar the next month, only the Barnharts were a half hour late. I don’t remember Martha’s excuse that time.<br><br>The only time that all of us were assembled and ready to start on time was when we met at the Barnhart’s. Finally, after a few months, while we sat around waiting for Martha and Scott to arrive someone suggested that we delay our starting time.<br><br>“It wouldn’t matter,” said Betty, “Martha is usually late for most meetings.”<br><br>“I enjoy the conversation between us chickens, but it’s a bridge club, not a talk club,” I said. “ Maybe we should stop meeting monthly and just play when we feel like it?”<br><br>We kicked around the idea of dissolving the club and decided to quit having regular meetings. We had a majority and Martha never got to vote. We finished the games before we told Martha. Of course we all had our excuses ready. Maybe she never learned the truth.<br><br>Long after the bridge club folded the Barnharts’ daughter Melissa, age about five or six, came to our house with an announcement.&nbsp;<br><br>“My mother is going to have a baby,” she said. “Momma said we could tell our close friends. I can tell you because you’re close friends. I can see your house from our house.”<br><br>I regarded her visit as an omen. Martha was still a friend.<br><br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:25:43.604561	2017-04-23 00:12:21.574644	2008	4	\N	\N	Non-Fiction	717	Middle	\N
64	A summer suprise	A soft breath of warm air under a crystal clear sky told of a late summer afternoon. It was indeed a mellow, lazy day with little activity in the neighborhood, and nearly suppertime. The roar and moan of lawn mowers had ceased for a time and traffic on the road was light.<br><br>Presently the relative quiet was interrupted by the sound of a barking dog soon to be joined by another and yet another. It seemed as if all the dogs within earshot had joined in a great chorus to perform a mighty anthem. A stranger on the scene might wonder just what catastrophe was about to occur to precipitate such a response, but it was not an extraordinary phenomenon. Such an outburst occurred frequently during this season.<br><br>Being household pets with nothing pressing to do, dogs were ever on the alert for anything that might excite their dog brains. Upon hearing a hissing sound that lasted for perhaps half a minute even a sleeping dog was alerted to a happening, and thus compelled to sound an alarm. The sound did not announce anything harmful, only a hot-air balloon or two. The large, pear-shaped, colorful balloons approached over a large field across the road from the row of houses and were visible from a mile away. They were a pretty sight, hanging there above field and forest and drifting along on the slight breeze. They attracted the attention of not only the dogs, but of the human residents, many of whom always came outdoors to watch them glide by. The sight made one almost wish to be in the basket suspended below the bag of hot air. The main objection to the wish may have been the hissing sound of fire directed into the open throat of the balloon. Got to keep that air hot to stay afloat.<br><br>A variation in the script occurred one day as evidenced by the arrival of a couple of vehicles hauling open bed trailers that parked at the edge of the field where soy beans had been recently harvested. Soon after that a red and white striped balloon became visible over the horizon followed by a black and white one a little later. Evidently they had scheduled a landing just across the road from us. We had front row seats.<br><br>The red and white balloon appeared bigger and bigger as it approached and began to lose altitude. The crew on the ground scurried around getting ready to assist in the landing. As the red-and-white descended, the man in the basket manipulated ropes attached to the balloon to tilt the balloon forward as the basket lightly settled to the ground while the ground crew gathered other ropes. The balloon leaned forward and settled to the ground as the air was expelled.<br><br>While the crew worked to pack up the deflated balloon and the basket, and load the rig into the trailer, the black and white balloon was obviously descending for a landing. It seemed to be descending too slowly. At this rate it would land just short of the trees at the edge of the field and tangle up in the woods. What could stop a wreck that might injure the passengers in the basket? The operator must have misjudged the wind speed. At the very last second the burner hissed to life sending a jet of blue flame into the nylon bag causing it to hesitate in its descent. As the air heated, the balloon stopped falling and began to rise ever so slowly. The light wind carried the black-and-white on toward the woods as it gradually crept skyward. Everybody watching held his breath until at last the basket barely cleared the trees and moved on. Then its chase crew piled into their car and headed for their alternate landing field.<br><br>A great unanimous sigh of relief went up when the balloon cleared the trees. It seems that everyone in the neighborhood had turned out for the unexpected show on a normally quiet and peaceful afternoon.	1	2017-04-21 23:20:40.011904	2017-05-01 22:50:11.95232	2008	5	hotAirBallon.jpeg	\N	\N	684	\N	\N
63	Woes of Long-distance Courting	It was an unsettled time of life for him, a time for discovery. He had earned a college degree, served his stint in the U.S. Army and had a steady job. The man lived in a comfortable room at the home of an aged widow who rented her three upstairs rooms to young men. As a new hire, he had much to learn in his job. He nevertheless felt secure in his employment, but he was far from his familiar environment. He sorely missed the mountains where he grew up. He would settle for some fair-sized hills. He longed for the company and companionship of a woman, her comforting touch.<br><br>The man had courted a vivacious, blue-eyed girl with silken blond hair as fine as the web of a spider while at the University and had corresponded with her ever since. He secretly hoped to marry her one day, but hadn’t felt ready to make the commitment. He knew he faced the military draft and couldn’t face the possibility of leaving behind a young widow. Besides, the girl’s stepmother didn’t approve of the girl’s association with a common hillbilly. No doubt she had some other bum in mind for her. The man had another even greater obstacle; two hundred miles separated the pair. In the days before the Eisenhower Administration and interstate highways the trip took seven hours or more on two-lane roads. The trips were too infrequent to suit either of them.<br><br>One of these trips seemed to be inspired by the fine fall weather and a good forecast for the weekend. The aroma of wood smoke in the cool air from someone’s fireplace, a yellow leaf on the sidewalk, the sound of boys playing touch football, and a taste of cider all conspired to urge him to travel. The journey was pleasant, if long. Broad fields of golden soybeans lay by the northwest Ohio roadside as well as cornfields being harvested. Moving south through towns and villages into a terrain of rolling hills where Jack Frost had been with his brush, leaving his unfinished work among the trees, then on to the almost never-ending streets of Cincinnati he traveled. Once over the Ohio River he was again among the foothills where Jack Frost had just barely begun his work. He wanted to stop and find a trail through the woods but he resisted and went on and soon came to rolling pastures with white rail fences and thoroughbred horses beyond.<br><br>Lexington at last! He and his girl dined and danced the evening away. They went for a drive in the country the next day, viewing the horse farms and small towns around Lexington. Late in the afternoon they headed back to her home. They were still a long walk from town when his car ran out of gas.&nbsp;<br><br>“Out of gas in broad daylight,” she said, “Poor planning. Fortunately there’s a farmhouse right over there. There’s a tractor near the barn; maybe they will sell you some gas.”&nbsp;<br><br>“It’s surely worth a try,” he said, and went to inquire. The farmer was very kind and supplied a gallon or two of fuel. The pair thanked the farmer and went on their way. After a snack the man delivered his girl home, bid her adieu, bought gas and headed back to Ohio.<br><br>All went well on his trip back until he passed Dayton and he noticed his gas gauge that registered nearly empty. He began watching for an open service station. It was late and most stations were closed. He drove through Troy and around town burning his gas without finding one. The next town was Piqua ten miles up the road. The gauge showed empty but he drove on ever hopeful of finding gas. He drove into town on fumes. He was sure that he would spend the rest of the night parked on the street when he spied a sign against the night sky that looked like GULF. He approached and—eureka the place was open. He dragged in home at about two o’clock in the morning. He was not discouraged, just glad that he made it home, but still unsettled.<br><br><br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:19:05.335713	2017-05-19 18:19:19.900766	2008	3	\N	Lexington, Kentucky and  Lima, Ohio, and the road between	\N	723	Middle	\N
32	The Rescue	Could it have been a mass suicide attempt? Or, perhaps a sudden storm was the cause. The little boy and his mother had first noticed them, wearing their orange and black, floating on their sides just out of reach of the shore. Other lifeless bodies littered the beach.<br><br><blockquote>It was an odd feeling floating on my side, unable to right myself. The sun warmed me from above, but at the same time I felt cooled by the water below. I liked the feeling of floating, so unfamiliar to me. Somewhere in my dreamtime I have a memory of being wet like this. It had seemed to take forever to dry off, while I stretched and tried to straighten myself out.&nbsp;</blockquote><br>The woman cupped her hands beneath the first one she could reach, and lifted him gently, letting the water drain from his limp body. The little boy blew gently on the lifeless form, holding him up for the breeze to help dry and revive him. It seemed a hopeless cause. The poor thing just lay there, so young and beautiful and helpless. The mother told the child it was time to go, but they just couldn’t bring themselves to leave the victim there on the beach, so they cradled him gently as they made their way home.<br><br><blockquote>When I first came to my senses, I knew I was being transported. I heard loving voices and felt cool breezes. I was no longer trapped by the tide, and though I could now move my legs, I hadn’t the strength to get up. Somehow I felt safer now, with a sense of peace and hopefulness.</blockquote><br>On the way home the survivor started to stir and made a few feeble attempts to get up, but finally seemed to relax as his rescuers talked to him gently and tried to reassure him that he would be all right. The boy’s grandparents waiting for them at home were sorry to hear of the tragedy on the beach. They suggested that the patient might be hungry, and set about making an elixir of quince jelly mixed with water.<br><br><blockquote>Bye and bye, when I was able to get up, they offered me a dish of some sort of sweet soup. I was ravenous as I sucked up that heavenly nectar. After supper my hosts entertained themselves by posing for photos with me. With my belly full, I spent a restful night. By morning I was getting around on my own much to the delight of my new friends. They took me outside onto the balcony and bid me farewell. I spread my wings and took to the air. No butterfly was ever more grateful to flutter bye-bye.</blockquote><em><br></em>By Catherine Sarwar and her dad, RD Jessee	1	2017-04-21 00:53:07.661901	2017-04-23 00:12:21.487868	2005	7	\N	\N	\N	479	\N	\N
96	Grandma's Soap	Many people of my grandparents’ generation lived on farms away from towns with industries and stores. My grandparents were of this ilk. They lived pretty much self-sufficient lives with little money to spend, save what little they got for products raised on the farm. They used the money to buy things they could not produce on the farm: flour, salt, sugar etc. Dad’s folks raised sheep in the hillside pasture for their wool for making clothes and quilts. They had a blacksmith shop for iron product needs. I never witnessed any woolen operations or blacksmithing work, but I did see Grandma Wells make soap one day.<br><br>Grandma brought out an oval cast iron vat about a foot wide and two or three feet long. She built a fire in a prepared place, set the vat over the fire and poured some water into the vat. She disappeared for a few minutes and returned with buckets filled with an awful looking mess that turned out to be grease and pieces of pork rind. She emptied the buckets of the chaotic mess into the vat, stirred it, added a couple cans of lye and went to do something else while it came to a boil. As the mixture heated and boiled, the pork skins began to disappear. Once they were gone Grandma picked up a chicken feather and dipped the end of it into the soup. Part of the feather was missing when she removed it. She repeated the test a few times until she retrieved the feather whole. She then doused the fire and let the soup cool. When she came back to the vat it had cooled and [viola!] a layer of brownish yellow soap lay on top of the soup. She cut the soap into bars and set them aside to cure, while the soup in the vat retained all the useless stuff including solid waste. Now, instead of a chaotic mess, she had a usefu1 product.<br><br>As I think back on this incident I see the greasy mess as a society in chaos, having no rules and no discipline. The lye, though harsh, is a set of values and morals from God.	1	2017-04-22 16:58:58.989221	2017-04-23 00:12:21.527872	2009	2	\N	\N	\N	369	\N	\N
74	Screech Owl Poem	Asleep until sundown, he stirs, yawns, peers about, stretches, scratches, shakes head to clear brain fog and waits. His nightly mission begins on silent wings, ever vigilant for movement on the ground. A twig moves, a sudden drop, talons grasp a vole or a mouse. Ah, breakfast! He surveys his land, stops at its edge and recites his claim like a whistle running down stair steps. Who? Our neighborhood screech owl.<br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:29:51.791246	2017-04-23 00:12:21.587603	2008	7	\N	\N	\N	73	\N	\N
78	Headpole	“Stephen starts to school this fall,” his mother said one day in a casual conversation with some other women.<br><br>“Do you know who his teacher will be?”<br><br>“Mrs. Headpole, I hear.”<br><br>Upon hearing the name, one of the women broke into a broad smile, clasped her hands to her breast and said “Wonderful, she’s the best. I’m sure he’ll like her.”<br><br>There were nods of approval from other ladies, some of whom had had kids in her class. Stephen’s mom crossed her legs and relaxed, pleased to hear the positive testimony. She had pause to be concerned as Stephen had always been a bit mischievous. For example, as a toddler he opened a door to the under-counter kitchen cabinets, entered with pots and pans flowing out behind him before he emerged from a second door sporting a big grin. And there was the time he pointed to the chubby butcher at the grocery store and said, “Look mom, a fat head.” Et cetera, et cetera.<br><br>Things seemed to go pretty well for Stephen in first grade. He may have had a little more challenge with discipline than others. Both his mother and his father raised their eyebrows the day he brought home a paper with his name atop spelled “NEHPETS”. It was always unclear whether the boy had temporary dyslexia or if he was playing a joke on his teacher. He never learned to write cursive in first grade as his parents had, only upper case printing.<br><br>He nevertheless was passed to second grade and, believe it or not, he had the same teacher that he had in first grade. He and a little buddy got into boy-trouble in class as before. Once after a distraction of the class by Stephen, his buddy was heard to say, “Thank God that wasn’t me.”<br><br>Stephen got satisfactory grade reports throughout second grade. Evidently grades “A, B, C, etc.” along with phonics had fallen over the cliff. He brought his “Dick and Jane” reading book home occasionally and demonstrated his reading prowess. He would open the book and say each word just as it was written with nary a mistake. By the end of the term he could read the whole book through, or open it to any page and read it without error. The book was well done with a colored picture on each page depicting Dick, Jane and dog Spot in various activities.<br><br>This kid was just too good. Mom’s brow raised and her mouth skewed to one side as she decided to test him. She covered the picture on a page and told him to read that page. He looked at the print for a pained moment and said, “Dick, uh ran, uh to ----uh, I forget the next word—” It became crystal clear that the child could read only pictures, even after two years with the “best”. His teacher should have warned the parents of his reading failure. Either she didn’t test him or she didn’t care. Stephen was obviously a bright boy with a logical mind. How else could he learn a text from just pictures? It evidently made more sense to memorize the words than to learn hundreds of words by the gaze and guess method.<br><br>“This will never do,” Mom said, “He can’t go into third grade if he can’t read, even if they pass him. Looks like he’ll be in school this summer.”<br><br>That’s exactly what happened. For six weeks he was tutored by Cal Workman, an expert reading teacher. At the end of the period Stephen could read at sixth grade level in spite of the “ best teacher”.<br><br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:32:10.240958	2017-04-23 00:12:21.595395	2008	3	\N	\N	\N	639	\N	\N
76	Lunch with Charlie	Buried among the junk mail I found a note from a long time pal and fellow engineer, the last person I would have expected to venture near Lafayette, but his note said he would be driving through on his way back home from somewhere out west. His note was signed “Chucky D”, his own choice of a nickname. His real name is Charles Lanier D – wait, before trying to say his last name try the following: bough, cough, dough, tough, through. Strangely, none of these words rhyme with another nor with any part of his name. Now say “proof” and then his name, Doughman. His wife called him Lanier as did his mother. A few fellow workers got it right and called him Doughman, but to everyone else he was Charlie. So Charlie is coming to town; we must have lunch together.<br><br>It will be great to see Charlie again. I wonder if his appetite is as good as ever. I know we can’t find a pizza as good as we used to have at Beer Barrel Pizza, but we’ll find something good. Charlie is a few years younger than I and he admired me as a family man. I think I was a minor role model to him and he wished to raise a family such as mine. We worked on similar projects and helped each other where needed. Charlie was better than I at math and I appreciated his help with some of my problems, especially those involving differential equations.<br><br>A slowdown in our workload occurred in 1984. A division of the company that did work for the Navy at Annapolis, Maryland had plenty of work. Charlie and I were among those selected to go on an assignment to Maryland. Charlie went a few weeks before I followed. He had rented an apartment on the eastern shore across the Chesapeake Bay. I joined him there and we were house buddies during our stay. Each morning we traveled across the long bay bridge to work and back at night. We found lots of good places to have our meals. One favorite place served a meal of oysters in four different styles. One night after an early start we went to a restaurant where we ordered the “all you can eat” blue point crab special. The crabs were served in the shell and we spent a lot of time learning to get the meat out of the shell. Even after learning the technique it was slow going. We had two huge platters of crabs. When we finished the second it was almost bedtime and I was still hungry, but they were really good.<br><br>We went home on alternate weekends. On our non-travel weekends we frequently drove to the nearest Metro station and took the train on in to Washington to visit the museums and such. One time we were there for the cherry blossoms. A walk amongst those flowering trees is a walk in another world.<br><br>We were on the special assignment for half a year before we went back home to resume our regular jobs. During that time Charlie and I became better acquainted of course. Charlie was widowed a few years later, and after he retired got reacquainted with his high school sweetheart. They were married and live in her house on Long Island, N Y. The last I heard, he was working on the house with the idea of selling it.<br><br>It will be a pleasure and a privilege to have lunch with Charlie. While we enjoy some famous Louisiana food we’ll catch up on each other’s lives since we last talked. He’ll fill me in on the status of his house renovation and what he plans to do after that. I’ll learn about his kids, including the son who stayed in Lima and lives in the house where he grew up. I’ll ask him how he likes his second wife’s family. Naturally he’ll want to know how my family and I are faring and I’ll do my best to tell him.<br><br>The main question I have for Charlie is why in the world is he driving across the country alone. But wait. He didn’t say he was alone. I have not met his new wife. Maybe this will be a doubly pleasant lunch experience.<br><br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:31:15.722459	2017-04-23 00:12:21.602325	2008	4	\N	\N	\N	744	\N	\N
73	Embarrassment	Things went smoothly in first grade class for much of the morning of his first day. Miss Flannery executed her lesson plan. A great deal of the spoken word goes unnoticed by young minds. It’s not whether or not potty location and protocol were verbally explained. It is certain however, that no physical show-and-tell was conducted. Ralph Donald was ignorant about what to do when “nature calls” in these strange surroundings. He had been told to mind the teacher. He hoped for an early recess, but to no avail. Nature won’t be denied for long and finally won while the poor boy sat paralyzed. The mile walk home from school seemed much longer than it really was. Feet seemed to get heavier with each step. The lad had to face Mom, but he took some consolation in the knowledge that he had gained that day.<br><br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:29:21.951675	2017-04-23 00:12:21.608961	2008	7	\N	\N	\N	150	\N	\N

105	Yohe	Charlie Yohe seemed to be an easy-going sort of fellow who enjoyed life, including his job as an electrical engineer. He was about my age, or a bit younger, and roughly my size and better looking, according to some folks. Charlie and I both worked in the engineering department at Westinghouse. Although we had been acquainted for many moons, my earliest recollection of Charlie dates from the time when he operated a now-outdated analog computer, used to simulate electric power systems. The computer was useful in testing variables in the design of systems and devices. Charlie and his computer were of great help to my design work.<br><br>During our career we were called upon to travel together to consult with either a customer or a vendor. I don’t remember which, but it makes no difference to this story. We arrived at the airport early in the evening after a pleasant, uneventful flight from Dayton, Ohio. We rented a car and headed to our designated motel, which happened to be on our way to our business destination. A few miles down the road we came to a lit up place called Starlight Motel.<br><br>“This is the place?” I asked.<br><br>“That’s what it says on this note,” Charlie said, “let’s go see what we’ve got.”<br><br>There was a surprisingly large reception room, nicely furnished with comfortable chairs. It looked like a decent place, so we signed in and went to our rooms where we cleaned up a bit. The motel had no restaurant but the desk clerk told us of one nearby. Two hungry guys found the place and had pretty good leisurely meals, so leisurely that by the time we got back to the motel it was time to turn in for the night.<br><br>“Good night, Charlie. See you in the morning in the lobby to check out at about seven,” I said as we headed for our rooms.<br><br>After a fairly good night’s sleep, considering the strange bed away from home, I answered my wakeup call and got ready for the day. I checked out and sat down to wait for Charlie to show up when I noticed a body stretched out on a small couch in the corner of the lobby.<br><br>“Good morning, Charlie. Looks like you got up early. Am I late?”<br><br>“Hell no. I’ve been here all night. Managed to get in the public washroom and shave and wash up a while ago. Hung out here all night.”<br><br>“Strange,” I said.<br><br>“Went in my room last night to get ready for bed and heard a snore. Some dude was sleeping in my bed. I felt like the baby bear in the Goldilocks story.”<br><br>“Didn’t you tell the guy he was in your bed?”<br><br>“No. He looked too comfortable to disturb. I called the desk and asked for another room. The clerk mumbled something about a convention nearby and told me there were no rooms to be had. Thought I wouldn’t mind sleeping with a stranger, I guess. So I just bunked here for the night.”&nbsp;<br><br>“Did you get any sleep?”<br><br>“A little. Lets go find some breakfast.”<br><br>Our meeting went all right and we accomplished our mission, but I noticed that Charlie hid his mouth behind his hand a time or two.	1	2017-04-22 17:49:35.126739	2017-04-23 00:12:21.623038	2010	1	\N	\N	\N	584	\N	\N
69	Den Mothers	“You all have boys who want to be Cub Scouts. Is that right?” I said.<br><br>“Yes,” came the reply from all the ladies.<br><br>“Why does your boy want to be a Cub Scout, Jean?”<br><br>“He has a friend in school, and thinks it would be fun,” she said, joined by other mothers.<br><br>“He likes the uniform,” said another&nbsp;<br><br>“How about your boy, Juanita,” I said.<br><br>“Same as Jean’s boy. We visited one of your pack meetings and he had a good time,” Juanita said.<br><br>“Do you want your boy to be a Cub Scout?” I said, addressing the group that responded in the affirmative. “Why is that, Wanda?”<br><br>“I think it would be a good thing for him to interact with other boys his own age and to work with them,” she said.<br><br>“Well, very good. Of course I have some forms for you to fill out to get your boys registered,” I said, “Now I’ll tell you a little bit about the program.<br><br>“It’s a boy-parent program. We encourage parents to be part of the Cub Scout’s life. He will need help from a parent to do some of his projects.<br><br>“Young boys are still oriented toward their mothers, so they are organized into dens with a Den Mother. They meet weekly at her home where they do various things including getting ready for the monthly pack meeting.<br><br>“The pack meeting is a family affair. We present the awards that the Cubs have earned in their den meetings and at home. The boys present a skit or a stunt that they learn in the den meeting. Some of the boys are real hams as they show off for their families and the other Cubs.<br><br>“Of course, none of this is possible without Den Mothers. We have seven or eight new boys that want to join us. That’s enough for a new Den. Any questions so far?”&nbsp;<br><br>“Who’s the Den Mother?” someone asked.<br><br>“I guess we’ll know before we get done here,” I said. “Are you volunteering?”<br><br>“No,” she said, “I’d have no idea where to start.”<br><br>“We have some Den Mothers here who’ll be more than glad to help,” I said, “The Boy Scout Council has printed material with far more ideas than you can ever use. And each boy should have his own Cub Scout manual. I’m sorry to have to tell you that I don’t have a list of names of women who are lined up to become Den Mothers, so I need a volunteer for the job”<br><br>“I’d not mind doing it, but I have a job that takes most of my time,” said Sally.<br><br>“I do too,” said Sue. “When do the dens meet?”<br><br>“After school is a good time,” said Betty, a Den Mother, “but I’ve known some that meet on Saturday morning.”<br><br>“Why don’t you ladies talk it over for a few minutes?” I said, “Maybe you can find a volunteer among you.”<br><br>“I’ll do it,” said Jean after a ten-minute buzz. “I expect to get a lot of help as you promised.”<br><br>“Congratulations,” I said. “You’ll get all the help you need, and you’ll have a good time at the job. You may unlock the door now, Betty.”<br><br>	1	2017-04-21 23:24:31.702573	2017-04-23 00:12:21.629794	2008	4	\N	\N	\N	603	\N	\N
142	Thoughts of Childhood	Daddy had his dreams in the mid-1920’s of making the little house in Virginia a place of his own liking. He had a wife and two little kids to occupy the house. Before I was old enough to start school I noticed things such as grape vines and fruit trees he planted around the place. I remember the trays in the cellar where he had various kinds of seeds sprouting. He finished the attic to make a third bedroom. There was no hint that he had any notion of moving.<br><br>While I was in second grade I heard adults talk about a crash in the stock market. Of course this meant nothing to me, a second grade child. Hearing that people jumped out of tall buildings meant to me that they must be crazy. What did mean something to me was that Daddy came home one day and announced that he had lost his job. That started a string of events that caused our family to start all over in Kentucky. By that time the Great Depression was in full swing, and aided by Roosevelt’s New Deal would last for another ten years until it was traded for another world war.<br><br>The depression changed the lifestyle of most folks. Many people lost jobs and frequently a man on his way to seek a job somewhere showed up at our door looking to work for food. Even at my young age I heard about people selling pencils, apples and lots of other small stuff on the street to earn a little money. “Brother can you spare a dime,” a common request even made it into song. The government saw to it that pigs were killed on farms that raised too many and lowered the price of pork. Plowing under crops was done for a similar reason. People where I lived thought such things completely stupid. To add insult to injury great dust storms darkened the sky during drought in the west.<br><br>But it was not all bad. It was the heyday of big bands. They played music that had real notes arranged to make melodies that people sang, unlike the pitiful stuff that passes for music today.<br><br>Talkies replaced the old silent moving pictures. Movies that made the viewer feel good were the style of the time. Nearly all had a happy ending. Evidently that was the kind that sold well to a depressed public weary of waiting for hard times to end.<br><br>Nearly all I can remember of my growing up years happened during the depression when Daddy changed jobs often and my schooling was interrupted in third grade. It seemed that I spent my whole growing up time in school. My favorite part of school was summer vacation. I felt that I had nothing to say about my life when in school. In summer, quite the other way, at least some of the time I could choose the things I did. It was when I got into high school that I began to see the point of school. They finally offered things I liked: science, and mathematics other than arithmetic. And there were other things like singing and football. I think I was glad to be growing up so that I could make my own decisions, and yet I’d miss doing boyish things, Boy Scouts, wading and swimming in the river, climbing the mountainside.<br><br>Although Daddy changed jobs often, he was never unemployed, thus he had a steady paycheck, which while not high, kept us on a steady course. We survived the depression learning to use what we had sparingly. Even so, Daddy bought me a bicycle and saw to it that I went to college. My bicycle wasn’t as fancy as my friend Jimmy’s but it ran just as fast.<br><br>If I could speak to the child I would simply encourage him to learn to love to read. The child never learned to read well, so he was a slow reader and reading always took too long. He needed practice reading some really interesting short stories.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall I remember my childhood as satisfactory, but not outstanding. I was never abused but always loved by my parents. What more could I ask?	1	2017-04-22 18:45:21.850418	2017-04-23 00:12:21.636632	2012	1	\N	\N	\N	725	\N	\N
147	Bessie	Witnesses were not sure but thought that the old lady had finished her day’s work at Jack’s cafeteria where she tended the salad section of foods on display for customers’ selection. She may have taken a detour from her regular course to conduct some business while downtown. With her purse under her arm she was likely to have been on her way to the bus stop and home. Walking in no particular hurry she suddenly felt her purse slip from its place under her arm. She turned to see her purse retreating down the street in the possession of a young thug. “Well now, we can’t have that,” her motions spoke, as she turned in hot pursuit of the thief. Before he realized that he had not picked on a mere patsy, the purse had been retrieved by its owner. The cowardly purse snatcher disappeared among the pedestrians and into a downtown alley.<br><br>Something about this story reminded me of my mother in law. It must have been the idea that the old lady may have worked at Jack’s. It didn’t seem like her to be chasing young thieves down the street. She was the grandmother of all my children.<br><br>I had always wanted a good mother in law once I married. I told Mary that the reason I married her was to get a good mother in law. Mary said she married me so that she could wear high heels without looking down at her escort.<br><br>Enough of the nonsense, let’s get back to the mother in law. I knew her only as a genteel widow, mother of three, who still lived outside of Lima, Ohio where she grew up.&nbsp;<br><br>Her first daughter was married to a mail carrier. Her son was in the Marine Corps. Her younger daughter, the apple of my eye, lived at home. After I married the apple, Mrs. Bess Werff became known to me as Bessie.<br><br>Unlike her tall, slender daughter Bessie was maybe 5’3” when she stretched. She had straight gray hair of medium length. She had a middle-aged look and usually alert. Her glasses made it hard to tell the color of her eyes.<br><br>Bessie was nearly deaf, scarcely able to hear anything without a hearing aid. She had a dealer who took particular interest in her and was always on the alert to find a better instrument for her. Most of her life she carried a bulky device under her clothes with a wire to a bone conduction receiver behind one ear. Despite her handicap she and I had many an argument, but always friendly.<br><br>Bessie enjoyed her grandchildren and they all loved her. They always insisted that Granny spend the night before Christmas with us.<br><br>Bessie loved her garden. She raised tomatoes, summer squash, beans, carrots and all sorts of vegetables. She took pride in her flower garden. She had blossoms from early spring until killing frost.<br><br>Her son Bob lived with Bessie from the time that he returned from WWII until his marriage several years later. During that interval my family enjoyed frequent visits to Granny’s. Once left to live alone, however, Bessie sold her place and moved to town. With only a small apartment to look after, she had time for other things. She got a job at Jack’s where she worked for several more years.<br><br>The day after we heard the story of the hoodlum chase, Bob brought his mother to my house for a visit. She sported a brand new purse that had a shoulder strap. “Ah ha, so you are the thief chaser I heard about,” I said.<br><br>“Yes, it will be harder for the next hood to get away with this purse.”<br><br>I should have remembered the card we had received in the mail not too long before, that said “Granny’s off her rocker,” and then went on to explain that she had gotten up and gone on a bus trip to the Grand Canyon. I should have realized that anybody with that much gumption would surely have exerted herself to save her purse.	1	2017-04-22 18:47:37.980987	2017-04-23 00:12:21.645692	2012	1	\N	\N	Non-Fiction	715	\N	\N
144	The Wedding	HELEN: A pretty young woman. Brown eyes and a pleasant smile soft brown, shoulder-length hair. Married. Likes to flirt with men.&nbsp;<br><br>GENE: A vivacious, blue-eyed, former Texan, democrat, opinionated, likable. Mother of four.<br><br>MOE: A slightly overweight woman, brown eyes and hair, sharp nose. Kids around with men at work, not serious with them.<br><br>JAKE: A young boy of eight or nine who likes weddings.<br><br>JACK: A sales rep for the company of the groom. Blond, curly headed, handsome, single<br><br>WILL: A guy who likes to attend functions.<br><br>“Hi Jean! Looks like they’re finally going to tie the knot. How long has this pair been going together?” said Helen as they approached the Church door.<br><br>“Oh, hello Helen. Durned if I know. She’s been working at the Plant for about four years, so I’d guess it’s less than that, wouldn’t you say J B,” said Jean as she eyed her husband.<br><br>“Well, no matter. I’ve known couples that got married after going steady for ten years,” said Helen.<br><br>“She’ll be a beautiful bride. Why else would they go through the trouble and expense of a big wedding?” someone was heard to say as they filed into the Church.<br><br>Inside the Church, attendees of the wedding were greeted by an usher who separated friends of the bride from those of the groom and seated them on the proper side of the center aisle, while the organist played soft romantic love songs.&nbsp;<br><br>Jack, a veteran of many weddings but not of his own,<br><br>was the senior of the ushers. His blond, curly hair complemented his blue eyes and handsome face. He was a sales representative for the groom’s company.<br><br>Joe, the other usher was a personable friendly fellow. Unlike his fellow usher, Joe had no curls on his head. In fact Joe had no hair where his curls should have been if he had had curls. Yet he was a young man, still in his twenties. Joe and Jack did a good job in getting the people seated toward the front,<br><br>A friend of the bride with a fine baritone voice sang two of the bride’s favorite songs before her arrival.&nbsp;<br><br>Meanwhile in a secluded closet or something similar near the front of the Church the nervous groom sat waiting for his cue to show his face down front. Despite the company of his “best man” it was an interminable wait. Why was the guy singing so slowly. Why two songs? Wasn’t one enough? Then suddenly it was time to move out to receive his bride. Knees shaking, he made his way out to meet her. Instead of his bride, he saw a bevy of young women coming down the aisle. They, too, moved slowly. Nothing to do but wait while they took their places down front. Finally there was a familiar sound, a theme of Mendelssohn from his “Midsummer Night’s Dream”, The Wedding March. Glory be, here came the bride. A man stepped forward and presented the bride to her groom.<br><br>During the procession a boy of seven or eight sat at the aisle with his mother. As the bride passed, the boy looked up at his mother and whispered, “She sure is a pretty lady, Mom.” This was not the boy’s first wedding. He liked to go to weddings.<br><br>Back to the main event, the Clergyman asked the “Do you” questions and got the correct “I do” answers. The rings were passed with no trouble. The “Man and Wife” pronouncement was made, and the “You may kiss the bride” permission was accepted by the groom with gusto. Once the groom came up for air the guy in charge said, “Let me present to you Mr. and Mrs. Robins, John and Clara. They will greet you at the reception next door”.<br><br>The newlyweds led the way inside the large area supplied with tables and chairs, as if one was meant to stay a while. People lined up to offer congratulations to the couple. Many took a table afterward and others left, having things to do. A number of folks kissed the bride as if it were the last chance.<br><br>When Helen and her husband reached the couple he took a turn at kissing the bride. Helen loved to flirt with men and she’d not miss a golden opportunity that presented itself. She congratulated the bride with a handshake and gave the groom a big smooch on the mouth. He looked surprised, but only because he didn’t know Helen.<br><br>Once the line had dwindled away the newlyweds took to the cake cutting ceremony. After doing silly things like stuffing cake into each other’s mouths they thanked everyone for coming, for the gifts and invited all to help themselves to snacks they would find on the table and to the wedding cake, that would soon be sliced.&nbsp;<br><br>When the people were engaged in stocking up on snacks the newlyweds slipped out of the hall to change clothes. They intended to leave on their honeymoon very soon.<br><br>“Is John driving his car when they leave here?”<br><br>“I believe so.”<br><br>“I hope he had a good hiding place for it. Considering the faces I have seen here today he’ll need a good place.”<br><br>“I heard that John got his old buddy, Bob, to take care of it for him. Bob’s a pretty reliable fellow.”<br><br>“Yeah, but Jack and a couple of his team are here. Speaking of Jack I haven’t seen him for a while, nor Joe.”<br><br>“And where is old trusty buddy Bob?”<br><br>“Oh there he is. He’s just coming in from outside.”<br><br>By and by John announced that they must leave, and headed toward the door. He stopped short when he saw his car that Bob had brought to the front of the hall. The windows were down and a chain held a metal sign announcing to the world that here was a pair of honeymooners. The car could be entered only from the passenger side because of the chain. Bon Ami messages covered most of the available space. A lot of tin cans followed to make sure they didn’t go unnoticed.<br><br>John stared in bewilderment for a very long moment, then grasped Clara’s arm and got into the car, pulling her in after him. John announced his intent to find a shop with a bolt cutter to remove the chain. However, Bob could stand it no longer and gave John the key to the lock that completed the loop of the chain.	1	2017-04-22 18:45:54.303035	2017-04-23 00:12:21.652778	2012	1	\N	\N	\N	1165	\N	\N
145	The Absent Photo	Ursula, one of my granddaughters, and I sat at the table with an old photo album open in front of us. It was not just old but old fashioned as well. It had black pages and pictures were held in place by those little corner pockets that were glued to the page to hold the pictures in place.<br><br>“Who is the cute little naked kid in the wash tub?” Ursula inquired.<br><br>“That would be your Granddaddy Jessee, I believe,” said her granddaddy.<br><br>“Wow! That’s more of you than I ever expected to see at one time.”<br><br>“Good lookin’ huh? Too bad good things don’t last long enough. Now here are some pictures of my aunts and uncles, my mother’s siblings. This one is my youngest uncle, Lonnie. There are Clyde and Kyle. I don’t have a picture of Claude. And here are my two aunts, Odette and Idyle, better known as Tump. And here is their sister Ivo with Isaac, my parents.”<br><br>“Now here’s a picture of my Grandmother, Octavia Wells, the smartest person in the world, or so I thought when I was in third grade.”<br><br>“Where’s your granddaddy? Don’t you have a picture of him?”<br><br>“No, I don’t remember ever seeing a picture of him. I guess I’ll just have to tell you about him. He was your great great granddaddy, you know,” I said as we continued to peruse the album.&nbsp;<br><br>Francis Marion Wells was my granddaddy. Of course I had another, James Abel Jessee of whom I know much less about. So I shall stick to Granddaddy Wells.<br><br>I’ve heard it said that in his younger days Granddaddy was a choir leader. From what I knew of him that came as a surprise. He did sing pretty well. When I was just a little fellow he set me on his knee and sang to me, his first grandchild.<br><br>In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries it was a custom in rural southwestern Virginia to hold singing conventions, a mostly all day affair with dinner on the ground. My parents took me to one when I was a child. I can see Granddaddy as a young man taking over the singing for part of these meetings, and he’d do it well.<br><br>Granddaddy was a famer as were most men of his time. He had a farm in the mountains of Virginia. His place was in a hollow that he shared with railroad tracks along one side of the hollow. The farm comprised some bottom land and adjacent hillsides where he grew corn, potatoes, hay for the cows and his horse, chickens and most all his food needs. He had an orchard atop a nearby knoll.<br><br>Of course I was acquainted with Granddaddy only in his latter years, so anything I report in his young days is only hearsay.<br><br>Granddaddy lived in a well built log house with a big fireplace, a roomy loft, a full front porch and an added-on kitchen and dining room. The walls of the main part of the house were papered with many layers of newspapers to keep the cold winds at bay. One could read favorite comics over and over until someone pasted up new papers. Granddaddy lived in this house with all those who had not left home. Beds occupied three corners of the room. A sturdy oak floor kept feet off the ground. Granddaddy was in charge of the big room at night. How do I know? Conversations went on as usual until Granddaddy said, “Fix my bed Tave.” Without a word Octavia rose, took a few steps and turned down the covers on his bed. Soon after that everybody went to bed.<br><br>Unlike the Jessees, Granddaddy was of average height, three or four inches under six feet. His blue eyes sparkled above his soup-strainer moustache.&nbsp;<br><br>His bald pate made him wear a hat outdoors. Walking along the road he might meet a fellow-traveler who’d say, ”Hot enough for you?”<br><br>His reply would always be, “I never mind the weather so the wind don’t blow.”<br><br>Granddaddy had few, if any, teeth by the time I knew him, but that didn’t stop him enjoying a good apple. It worked this way: He first cut the apple in halves across the care. Holding an apple half in his left hand he scraped the flesh of the apple with the rounded end of a table knife until he had a portion of soft, juicy apple for his toothless mouth. When he was done he had left only the peel and the core. At the dining table he used a similar technique except that the soft food didn’t require scraping. His daughters, however, took a dim view of his method at the table.<br><br>Granddaddy wasn’t always easy to get along with. He had only one curse word that I ever heard. Anyone can guess what it was. Right, it was shit. Many times that word was all that was needed to get his point across. Other times, however, he required a more definitive treatise and the expletive showed up numerous times. When he was done there was no more to be said.&nbsp;<br><br>About once a week Granddaddy gathered in-season produce from the farm and took it and the buttermilk that Grandmother had churned and perhaps some butter, loaded the wagon and headed off to town to peddle his wares. On his way back he stopped at the Post Office which was actually part of a local store with post boxes. His was number 44, East Stone Gap. There was no rural delivery service there at the time. He made sure to stop at the Post Office when the Sears Roebuck catalog was likely to be in the mail. While at the Post Office he spent a few pennies for candy for his grandchildren.<br><br>“Well, Ursula, now you know more about the guy whose picture you didn’t see than about those you saw. Any questions?” I said..	1	2017-04-22 18:47:01.575661	2017-04-23 00:12:21.665674	2012	1	\N	\N	\N	1053	\N	\N
146	Catch Up	“The hurrier I go the behinder I get.” Somewhere I’ve heard those words before and they seem to describe me sometimes. But how can that be? I seldom get in a hurry. I learned long ago that hurrying often leads to mistakes that make me get really behinder. My problem must be deeper than this. But what could account for my behinder problem?<br><br>Perhaps in my younger days things seemed to go in a normal way and I didn’t notice getting behind where I should be. Maybe it was only later that I noticed I was getting behind at all. Gradual changes often go unnoticed for a long time. Then one day something takes longer than normal to finish. I think nothing of it until it happens again and again. In physics class I thought I learned that time is a constant quantity until a moving body nears the speed of light.&nbsp;<br><br>Also I notice that people are rushing around: to get to work, to spend their money shopping, and hurrying to do all things that need to be done. Hurrying through life is not limited to scurrying feet, but to tongues as well. I once was able to understand most talk I heard in English, but alas that is no longer true. Many people talk so fast that it is tiresome to listen to them for long before attention drifts off to another subject.<br><br>Try listening to radio advertisements and notice that most of them put as many words as possible into their time slot, be it understandable or not. Some give a phone number not once but maybe five times, each time at a rapid rate. If they wanted me to remember the number, the voice would have spoken the number slower and after a reasonable pause repeated it just once.<br><br>Really ridiculous ads are those where the voice races through the spiel to complete a glowing message only to have a “fine print” voice continue with what can only be assumed to modify the original message, spoken at a breakneck speed that even the speaking voice could likely not understand. Such ads are not welcome fare for my unhurried brain.<br><br>So what does all this speediness mean? Do people need to move faster than they did when I was young? Is there much more that has to be done than previously? Haven’t the multitudes of labor-saving devices made things easier so that folks can slow down and enjoy the gain in leisure time? Evidently not. Perhaps it only opened the way for more necessary things to exist.<br><br>Suppose that all this fast track stuff is only my imagination. It could be, but I don’t think so. Things I do seem to take longer than those same things used to take. Why is that? Uhm. Ah! I think I know the answer. As one grows older, time passes faster and faster. Time is not a constant thing as I thought. It is on an accelerating path. Next year an hour will not last as long as this year’s hour.<br><br>But wait. Let logic prevail. Maybe I came to the wrong conclusion. I think things really move too fast, but time does not really speed up as one grows older. It just seems that way. What really happens is that old folks just get slower and it’s harder to keep up.	1	2017-04-22 18:47:15.780989	2017-04-23 00:12:21.672802	2012	1	\N	\N	\N	583	\N	\N
148	Mother	After more than seventy years of absence from her, it is hard to recall in any detail things about Momma and me that would make a story that anyone would be interested in reading. In the beginning Momma was the proud parent of an extremely handsome and well-behaved little boy who was tolerant of his many admirers and their acts of admiration. Momma put up with much of this kid spoiling; it made her proud to be the mother of a star.<br><br>Unfortunately the sweet little boy grew into a regular kid who could no longer do no wrong. In case there be any question, I was that little boy. In my third year of life Momma gave me a little sister. Now Momma had two little people to look after. She must have done a credible job because we both grew to be adults. Momma looked after our needs as children and gave us love. She scolded me when I teased my little sister with a spider and told me that that was wrong. I protested, for I didn’t really have a spider. After that I behaved for a little while, maybe an hour or two.<br><br>I was eight years old when my family, because of the great depression, moved from our country home to a town. The move was very hard on Momma. She believed that it was much harder to raise children in town. I don’t know if it’s true, but we didn’t give her much trouble.&nbsp;<br><br>Momma had flu in the epidemic of 1918 and nearly every weakness or sickness that she had she blamed on that flu. She could have been right for many people didn’t even survive the epidemic.<br><br>Our family was a regular Church-going unit. Nevertheless Momma wanted to be sure that we didn’t miss a chance to say yes to Jesus. Thus we went to a lot of revivals at various churches in town. She always urged me to go for the alter call, no matter that I had been several times before.<br><br>Momma was one who didn’t believe in wasting time waiting for meetings to start. As a result she and the rest of us, were late for things. One time I remember we were going on a train trip. We were in sight of the conductor when the train was about to leave the station. Daddy waved and the conductor happened to see us coming and held the train while we trotted the last several steps. I recall a second time when we didn’t quite make it.<br><br>During the depression Momma gave many a traveler a meal at our back door. New things were scarce for nearly everybody in those days. Momma didn’t throw anything away. A worn out garment served a second life by being patches for a not quite worn out one.<br><br>During those lean years Momma gave birth to a big baby boy. He grew into a fine little fellow, twelve years my junior. I believe that his birth took a lot out of Momma, for she didn’t seem to have much energy after he was born. Having both a pre school child and teenagers must have been quite a challenge to her.<br><br>I have little or no first-hand knowledge of Momma after I left home for college. I saw her only on short visits. I believe that she didn’t take good care of herself and she didn’t like to visit doctors or dentists. During the twenty years that followe her health declined until her death at age sixty-one.<br><br>I must admit that I was more my father’s child than my mother’s. He did things that interested me, and sometimes he would let me help. Nevertheless I loved Momma even when we disagreed.	1	2017-04-22 18:47:58.821895	2017-04-23 00:12:21.679636	2012	1	\N	\N	\N	659	\N	\N
149	Influences	Development of the characteristics of my life for the first ten years was almost entirely family oriented. Of course there was some influence of school but not enough to reverse the influence of family.<br><br>As a young child, my parents, my little sister and I lived close to my maternal grandparents, and therefore I must include them, along with aunts and uncles in my family. Being the firstborn grandchild, I held a unique place in the family. No doubt I was spoiled from too much attention in spite of my cute little sister. I wasn’t too spoiled to learn right from wrong, mostly. I’m not sure I knew what they all meant but I knew the Ten Commandments. It seemed that I hadn’t learned to not tease my sister, but this lesson came later when she had control of the length of her finger nails.<br><br>I was in third grade in the fall of 1929 when Daddy lost his job and moved his family to Kentucky. They left me for my grandparents to look after until I finished third grade. The reduced size of my Kentucky family left more room for outside influence on me.<br><br>We were well into the Great Depression which was itself a great teacher of humility. Things that were once taken for granted could no longer be treated so. For most folks all things were harder to own. I learned something about frugality.<br><br>In school I learned to respect those in authority. I learned to pass my courses without much effort, except for science and mathematics. I liked those subjects.&nbsp;<br><br>Just after my twelfth birthday, my mother gave birth to big baby boy (ten years too late to suit me). Now I had to give up my claim as uncontested number one kid because of a baby who grew into a cute blond curly haired little boy whose mother didn’t have the heart to cut his curls until he started to school.<br><br>I learned from my peers at school that at age twelve I could become a Boy Scout and they urged me to join their troop. I got permission and joined. The first thing I learned as a Tenderfoot was the Scout Oath. “On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country, to obey the Scout Law, to help other people at all times, to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight.” These precepts were not new to me. I had learned them at home and in Sunday School, but there they were made easy to remember. I learned many things as a Scout that served me well as an adult.<br><br>Learning to swim probably saved my life a time or two. Rudiments of a well organized camp site enabled me to teach my children to appreciate nature and the outdoors.<br><br>I learned determination, teamwork and fair play from my high school football coach. His motto was, “A team that won’t be beat can’t be beat.”&nbsp;<br><br>My first boss in my career as a junior engineer was a great believer in trying unconventional ways of doing things. Don’t do something a certain way just because that’s how it has always been done. He even wrote a book on creativity. He was a father-figure to me and some of his notions rubbed off on me. My real father may have contributed to that trait in me. Maybe that helped me decide to study engineering.&nbsp;<br><br>While serving in the Army I developed what some folks described as a nasty, stinking habit. They told me that it would cause lung cancer, a threat that I never believed and still don’t. Right or wrong, credit the Army and free cigarettes for my stinky habit. I enjoyed my smokes but gave them up starting with three weeks in the hospital. I no longer stink like stale tobacco smoke, but one might notice me with another flavor of stink.<br><br>It’s hard to stretch memory back through years of hardly ever thinking of what may have caused me to have certain character traits, much less what was the origin. I’d wager that by far most had roots in my family.	1	2017-04-22 18:48:18.049329	2017-04-23 00:12:21.686525	2012	1	\N	\N	\N	734	\N	\N
150	We're all goofy at times	Our esteemed leader admitted that she comes from a goofy family. Well, ‘goofy’ was not her word for it but it’s close enough it seems to me. At any rate I wondered if she thought that she expected her students to admit to being goofier than her family. It’s quite possible that some of us were even goofier.<br><br>I may as well start with my Uncle Kyle. He lived with his family about a mile from the village of East Stone Gap. Most every morning after he did his chores he walked to town to hang out with the gang of men there assembled. At lunch time he came back home, ate lunch and went back to town. Then he showed up at home again in time to do his evening chores and eat his supper. After supper he was done for the day. His sister claimed that the guys in town were loafers. Was he loafing or just taking a break? When he ran short of money he went to the shipyards in eastern Virginia and worked for a year or two then came back and continued his fellowship with the guys until he ran out of money, then back to the shipyards. By the way, he never got rich.<br><br>In my immediate family there were some things one might consider to be goofy. The children would stay in bed on Saturday morning too late. Their father had his own way of seeing that they were done sleeping. He simply played one his favorite symphonies on his hi-fi system with the orchestra extra loud. Soon all were awake and up before long. If that didn’t work soon enough he resorted to the old toe-pulling routine. Speaking of toes, while sitting on the couch with a certain individual it was wise to see that he had shoes on. Otherwise one might get pinched on the leg by a pair of toes that sneaked up while one was unaware of an attack.<br><br>How’s this for goofy? It’s the first day of summer vacation from school. A lad is looking forward to swimming and other summer fun. A stepladder stands in the driveway. The lad for an unknown reason climbs halfway up the ladder with a ball in his hand. He throws the ball to one side and overturns the ladder. Both the lad and the ladder end up lying on the ground. The ladder is unhurt but the lad suffers a broken wrist. With a cast on the arm, it’s good-bye to summer swimming.<br><br>A sister of this lad might have a tasty morsel on her plate that she is saving until last, one that’s so good that it makes her forget anything she ate that she didn’t like. If this sister sits beside the lad she had better keep a close watch on the lad. He has been known to snitch morsels from plates when nobody is watching.<br><br>Sometimes the sister would have a morsel that hung around on her plate for nearly the whole meal then suddenly disappear as if eaten. Ah but there was a slight of hand here. The morsel was a sausage patty stowed out of sight until it could be disposed of in the garbage. This tid-bit was discovered by confession.<br><br>About the middle of my kids’ growing-up years I bought a brand new Volkswagen bus, the deluxe model with sun roof and those cute little windows near the roof, the only truly new car I ever owned. Perhaps it was a goofy selection, but I liked it and there was plenty of room for the whole family together. Mary loved to drive the car, and when driving she waved at absolutely everyone she saw. Was that goofy?<br><br>Our family always took a vacation away from home. Once the least one grew old enough to stay out from underfoot we went tent camping at a state or national park. Maybe that was goofy but the children saw a lot of places they might never have seen. The goofiest scene of all, at least to our neighbors, must have been our packing the Volkswagen bus for our month-long camping tour of western national parks. We arranged the back seats to face each other and set up a game table between them, no doubt illegal these days. The rest of space was used to stow camp equipment. The roof rack was handy to stow two tents. Gear packed, four kids aboard, Ma and Pa up front and we were ready to roll the 35-horsepower bus down the road, goofy or not.	1	2017-04-22 18:48:38.818142	2017-04-23 00:12:21.693278	2012	1	\N	\N	\N	786	\N	\N
143	Balloon Ride	Outside the neighborhood dogs were excited and letting everybody know it. Such barking had not been heard since the dogs chased a fox through the nearby woods.<br><br>“What’s their problem Jack?” asked his wife Sue Lane during a momentary pause in the noise.<br><br>“Don’t know,” said Jack and he stuck his head out the back door. “Hear that hissing sound? I believe there is a hot air balloon close by,” and the dogs started their barking again.<br><br>“Yes I heard it. Let’s go outside and see,” Sue said. “There it is and it’s coming this way. It’s beautiful, with orange and green panels.” Another blast of burning gas hissed from the hot air generator keeping the craft airborne and then it was quiet again, but the dogs redoubled their greeting as the balloon floated closer. Soon passengers of the balloon waved a greeting and the neighborhood waved back at them.<br><br>“Wow, that was exciting,” Sue said after the balloon floated away and the dogs settled down.<br><br>“Yeah, it would be fun to go for a ride some time,” Jack said. “I’ll check into it.”<br><br>“But I’ll be scared to death of landing in a tree or worse.”&nbsp;<br><br>A few weeks passed in that Ohio summer and Jack came home with good news; at least he thought so. “We can go for a balloon ride without going over trees. Saturday we can go up in a tethered balloon without going anywhere except up and back down. You can get the feel of it. You might like it.” She agreed to try it and they showed up at the launch site on Saturday morning during a summer before most everybody was preoccupied with their cell phones.<br><br>“Good morning Jack. Is this your lovely wife? I’m Rick” greeted Rick Combs, his unruly hair waving in the slight breeze. We had several requests for short tethered rides today so I gave the chase crew the day off since we’ll be right here all day. You’re my first customers of the day, so relax and we’ll be ready to go shortly.”<br><br>“All aboard and it’s up for the ride. Is everybody all right?” Rick said.<br><br>“Feels different than it did on the ground. There’s a little sway, but I like it,” Sue said. As the balloon rose the view expanded so that they could see far beyond the usual scope. They had enjoyed the panorama for a few minutes when Jack looked down. What he saw was unexpected. They were not over the spot where they had risen from. It seemed to be a different field entirely. “Oh Rick,” he said, “Look down.”<br><br>Rick, who had been busy pointing out remote sights, looked down and exclaimed, “Oh crap! Our tether broke loose. That never happened before. We’ll have to find a place to put this beast down and find our way home. Meantime enjoy the ride, there will be no charge.”<br><br>“Oh Jack what are we going to do?” Sue said as she held on to her husband.<br><br>“Don’t worry honey. Rick knows how to handle the situation,” Jack said, only half believing his own words. Many anxious moments passed while Rick tried to calm his passengers. Presently there loomed ahead a field that looked like a pasture, green and inviting.<br><br>“I’ll try to maneuver a bit to the right and maybe we can land there,” Rick said.<br><br>“Go for it,” came words of agreement. The balloon drifted toward the green field, descending so as to contact the ground in the field near a road. Everyone looked about for cows in the pasture, but none could be seen. Just as the balloon was about to touch down someone spotted a dark figure approaching.<br><br>“Look, there comes a cow,” she said.<br><br>“Sorry,” said Rick, “that aint no cow. That’s a bull and I think he don’t want no company, no how!” and he fired up the hot air generator. The balloon began to rise very slowly. The bull charged on toward the balloon determined to either scare it off or fight it.<br><br>Back at the launch site things had not been as orderly as usual. Rick’s wife Betty had been busy trying to contact members of the chase crew on their day off. The tether lay on the ground detached from the balloon. Betty was also cancelling the rest of the rides of the day.<br><br>The balloon rose ever so slowly, much too slowly to suit the three in the basket, however it seemed all right with the bull. Either way he had won; he was rid of his company. Once again airborne the people together gave a great sigh and soon began looking for another landing site.<br><br>The chase crew, finally assembled, had only a vague idea where to look for the lost; only the soft breeze was their clue.<br><br>“It sounds like we’re home,” Jack said as the balloon approached a group of houses where it seemed that all the dogs in the county were barking.<br><br>“No I’m afraid not, but there may be a place to land nearby,” Rick said. And he was right. Across the road from the houses lay a fallow field that the balloon was headed for. Rick maneuvered the balloon to make good easy landing close to the road. His passengers were glad to get out of the basket, and assisted Rick by getting someone in the neighborhood to call Betty and report their location. Betty relayed the location to the crew by their radio. The crew arrived soon and helped Rick pack the balloon and basket for the next adventure. They took the passengers and the balloon back to their starting point of a few hours earlier.<br><br>“How was that for an exciting day?” said Jack.<br><br>“More exciting than for the dogs that started all this a few weeks ago,” Sue said, “and thanks for the ride, no bull.”	1	2017-04-22 18:45:37.416038	2017-04-23 00:12:21.700202	2012	1	\N	\N	Non-Fiction	1051	Early	\N
109	This I believe&nbsp;	“Nine-eleven” is a term that brings to mind a sad day in our nation’s history, one that should never have been. It seems to me that ample warning was available but the warning was ignored. Evidence not allowed to be shared between the FBI and the CIA is a prime example. But years before the event, terrorists had blown up our embassies, attacked our ships and tried to blowup the trade center, among other things. These things were all but ignored except for talk. Where was the will to bring the guilty thugs to justice?<br><br>After the brutal sneak attack on the twin towers using our own airlines as weapons there were many critics of our effort to learn terrorists’ plans of further attacks by tapping into telephone chatter. “George Bush is listening to our private conversations,” they charged.<br><br>Airline trips became an hour or two longer because of airport security. Despite the security a terrorist got on a flight and tried to light a bomb in his shoe. Now all passengers must take off their shoes. And shampoo or a bottle of water is suspected of being explosive.<br><br>Later on a terrorist with a bomb hidden in his underwear got aboard a flight, went into the lavatory and tried to set off his bomb. It seems to me that with a little bit of profiling this terrorist would not have gotten on the airplane. Didn’t this guy’s father warn against him? But profiling is not politically correct. Lets not offend anyone, even a potential terrorist. Instead, lets offend everybody else.<br><br>Because of the underwear bomber we now have the choice of body scanners or pat-downs where underwear is supposed to be. Millions of airline passengers face the indignity of such treatment. And guess what. The government is considering extending this stuff to trains and buses.<br><br>Despite our war hoping to wipe them out, terrorists must be laughing their heads off or at least smiling broad grins. I’m reminded of my days as an ornery little boy when I learned that my little sister was afraid of spiders. I could put her to flight by merely pretending I had a spider in my hand. So it is with terrorists; they need only to make us think that more terror is on the way. They have already cost us billions of dollars and wasted hours. They’re causing us to get used to lining up like sheep going to slaughter. To terrorists’ delight there goes another chunk of our freedom.<br><br>I believe the terrorists have won. We should probably start over. First we should throw political correctness into the trash heap, embrace profiling and stop treating citizens as the enemies.	1	2017-04-22 17:51:06.89768	2017-04-23 00:12:21.834837	2010	1	\N	\N	\N	465	\N	\N
173	Summer Job	It was summer 1941. I had just completed my sophomore year at Lincoln Memorial University where I was enrolled in pre-engineering curriculum. I applied for a transfer to the University of Kentucky to complete my engineering degree. I didn’t have any money and was therefore hoping to find a summer job. I had little prospect of finding a job in my hometown until I found a notice in the local paper stating that the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) wanted to hire people for the summer.<br><br>“Hey Dad, did you see this? TVA is offering jobs for the summer. Maybe they’ll have a job for me. I could assist an engineer in his work. I had a course in mechanical drawing, and in calculus, and physics,” I said, having no idea what an engineer’s job was like. I imagined that I would help with the design of a new project such as the electric power plant at Norris Dam, or something just as grand, or perhaps help to survey a new route for a high voltage transmission line.<br><br>“Go ahead and apply and see what they offer you. You can use the money,” said Dad.<br><br>“I’ll do it today,” I said and went to work spelling out all the pertinent things I had learned in my two college years.<br><br>In about a week I got a reply to my application, directing me to report to work on Monday morning at seven o’clock. I was surprised that the job was local. I was further surprised that I was advised to dress in outdoor work clothes and to bring a lunch. I arrived on time along with three other guys to meet our new boss, who was not an engineer but the foreman of the work crew.<br><br>“We’ll be goin’ to the Kentucky Utilities power plant seven miles down the river,” said the foreman. “We’ll be puttin’ in a sub-station there for the TVA. I’ll pick you up near your home every mornin’ and drop you off there after work. The pay is fifty cents an hour. Hop in the pick-up and we’ll be on our way.”<br><br>Approaching the power plant we crossed a railroad track where, as I learned later, trains yield the right-of-way to the highway traffic. We soon turned off the highway and over a bridge spanning the Cumberland River to the plant. We stopped at a large green lawn beside the brick building housing the electric generators. The lawn was already stocked with building materials and tools ready to be applied to the project. It seemed a shame to carve up such a nice lawn, but progress frequently requires tearing down for building up to take place.<br><br>“Well boys, grab a shovel and follow me. I’ll show you what to do with ‘em,” the foreman instructed. Oh well, so much for my visions of learning what an engineer might do on a job. Half a college degree is not really worth much, but at least I had a summer job.<br><br>It turned out that while the job was real work it was not as hard as making hay on the farm on a hot day. A few weeks later however, I had second thoughts about this. Our worksite was a two-tiered landscape with the ground rising steeply about eight feet to the upper tier. We had dug a square hole about ten feet deep and nearly as wide in the ground of the upper tier and constructed a wooden ramp connecting the two ground levels.<br><br>“Today we’re goin’ to haul concrete up the ramp and dump into the big hole you dug. Be careful to pour it into the forms we set up. Save your strength; it will be a long day,” the foreman advised. Was he ever right about that!&nbsp;<br><br>I took a wheelbarrow to the antique cement mixer for my first load and proceeded up the ramp. I had a good load, but not too burdensome I thought. I repeated this time and again, but was glad to sit down for lunch. All afternoon I repeated the trip until we must have been half done. They had brought some sandwiches and gave us another break to eat and rest, then back to work. By that time I was pretty tired but kept going, noting with each trip how far we still had to go. Each trip became more of a struggle as I noticed each load became heavier than the previous one and moved up the ramp slower and slower. Finally through ears numbed by fatigue I heard the blessed words, ”That’s enough.”&nbsp;<br><br>Fifteen hours after picking me up there, the truck stopped to let me off near home. I dragged my spent body over the edge of the truck bed toward the sidewalk. My feet hit the walk and my legs collapsed under me. Somehow I managed to get upright and start toward home when I heard the agonizing words, ”See you in the morning at seven.”<br><br>After that day the rest of my time on the job was easy, and I wondered why was TVA buying power from private utilities companies. Obviously TVA couldn’t supply its customers. Was it expecting new customers? The answer to my question came a few years later when I realized that the atomic energy facility at Oak Ridge required much energy. Without knowing it I had contributed in a miniscule way to the development of atomic bombs that ended World War II.	1	2017-04-22 19:21:41.656049	2017-04-23 00:12:21.714749	2008	1	\N	\N	\N	951	\N	\N
174	The Warning	It had been a good party and the hour was late. Charlie and his date got into his car and headed home. On the way to the girl’s house they approached a railroad crossing where the warning lights were flashing and the gates were closing. He glanced quickly to his right then to his left, and seeing no train proceeded in a tortuous path across the tracks. He made it across with time to spare and thought nothing more of it.<br><br>“Charlie, you’ve got to be careful. There’s a train coming,” the girl said with her heart in the throat.<br><br>“No problem, we had plenty of time” said Charlie and finished his drive, delivering the girl home on his way.<br><br>He was tired after a busy day and soon went to bed. It seemed to Charlie that he had been asleep only a moment when he was awakened by a light tug at his blanket. He pulled the blanket back up and went back to sleep but another tug exposed his shoulder and woke him again. He sat up in bed and looked around trying to see why his covers kept sliding down the bed. What he saw gave him a start. As he stared in disbelief, he saw his dead Uncle Ed who had been killed years ago when a train plowed into his truck. The apparition beckoned Charlie to follow.&nbsp;<br><br>Reluctantly he threw back the covers and set his feet on the floor. Presently he found himself in the passenger seat of an old-fashioned farm truck, beside Uncle Ed. There were children in the truck bed sitting on benches. They were neighborhood children from local farms on their way to Sunday school. They all seemed to be happy to be traveling through a beautiful countryside on a lovely day. A railroad crossing loomed ahead where the road rose sharply to meet the tracks. There was no train in sight but a whistle could be heard in the distance. Ed’s truck slowed to cross the tracks and unfortunately stalled before clearing the railroad. Ed tried in vain to restart the engine as the train approached.<br><br>“Get out,” Charlie yelled as he opened the door and jumped out striking his cheek hard against the door as he fled the truck. Ed tried once more to start the engine but he was too late. The train was closer than he thought and crashed into the truck scattering bodies along the track and demolishing the truck with Ed still inside. It seemed a long time that Charlie stood immobile at the gruesome scene before he found himself back on the edge of bed with Uncle Ed standing alongside. Charlie tried to speak but no sound came forth. Then Ed vanished. Charlie was sure that he had been dreaming. After all he had never believed in ghosts. It took a while but he finally went back to sleep.<br><br>“I had the most awful nightmare last night,” Charlie said to a friend the next day and related his experience of the night, “but I know it was just a dream.”<br><br>“Yeah, it sounded really bad,” his friend replied, “but Charlie, how did you get the black eye?”	1	2017-04-22 19:21:57.17469	2017-04-23 00:12:21.721632	2008	1	\N	\N	\N	552	\N	\N
175	What You See	“What you see is what you get,” is an old saying I heard somewhere. I don’t know where it came from or exactly what it means. Maybe it’s an old horse trader’s saying, meaning “let the buyer beware.” Maybe it’s another way of saying “seeing is believing.” From my personal experience I can say it ain't necessarily so.<br><br>Several years ago on a clear, starry, October night I looked up through the bare branches of a tree at a particular star and saw nearby a small constellation of seven or eight stars that I had never noticed before. I moved my focus to the constellation that simultaneously disappeared from my view. I refocused on the star and the constellation reappeared. This was a bit unsettling, for I had never noticed such a phenomenon before. I thought it must be astigmatism. Maybe I needed new glasses.<br><br>Months or maybe years later I noticed my reading lamps were not as bright as usual, or perhaps the newsprint quality had faded. I tried boosting my lamp’s intensity with brighter bulbs. This helped a little, for a while, but then the crossword puzzle had some strange little curves in the grid that seemed to change depending on where I focused on the grid. I realized that I had symptoms of age-related macular degeneration, AMD.<br><br>It soon became apparent that the small blind spot in the middle of my field of vision was growing. I could see all around the blind spot, but eventually that became dimmer. My friendly doctor was impotent in helping the patient except to say that I would probably not go completely blind and “maybe we can slow down the process.”<br><br>Despite the aggravation and the feelings of helplessness, I have seen some interesting things along the way. I never had any control over what I saw or when I saw it. Perfectly shaped little green trees no taller than a person appeared and bore bright red berries while I watched. Sometimes a scraggly little bush with only bare twigs grew a profusion of fine leaves as an asparagus plant, hiding all the bare twigs. My view of the roadside as we rode along the highway revealed young trees that never became closer as we approached them. The trees were ablaze with little egg-sized lights, perhaps masquerading as Christmas trees.<br><br>Sitting in a dimly lit room I saw line drawings of faces, usually on a brick-colored background. Most of these faces were new to me and of a great variety of shapes and expressions. There were men with bald heads, with moustaches, with beards of all lengths and shapes. Just about any face one could imagine showed up on this stage. I recognized some of the faces, Abe Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and John Wayne, for example. I saw few women, but those I saw had pretty fancy hairdos, mostly red. I never got a chance to study a face because it was always changing in either expression or into a different face. The change in expression was almost always toward a glum look.<br><br>I have seen other things, perhaps less interesting than faces. I have seem board fences with ivy crawling up them, plain brick walls, segments of straight lines arranged in the fashion of a spider’s web or a promiscuous pattern such as one might find in a flagstone walkway. A close-up of an elephant’s right eye appeared a few times.<br><br>One of the more common scenes was that of a ceramic tile floor. It was usually white, inch-square tiles laid in a spiral pattern around a small object such as a small statue, fountain or just a void. A white pattern always morphed into one with brightly colored tiles randomly placed throughout the tile floor. The colored squares changed position and color frequently, never static and boring.<br><br>I heard of other AMD people who saw much more interesting things than I have. One saw a group of little girls playing games in the front yard. Another saw a roomful of monkeys scampering about in her kitchen and in other parts of the house.<br><br>It has been a while since I have seen visions such as I have described, and I may never see another one. I did find it interesting to experience a tour through the world of surprises and see what there was to “see”. All this leaves me with the notion that “what you see is what you get” depends on who’s doing the looking.	1	2017-04-22 19:22:15.999321	2017-04-23 00:12:21.728358	2008	1	\N	\N	\N	775	\N	\N
151	Goodbye Dorothy	We’d had an especially pleasant trip back home from Zion, Illinois where we’d spent a week for Dorothy’s monthly series of treatments for her cancer. After a week at the hospital it was a pleasure to go home. The four-hour trip was usually somewhat of an ordeal, and we arrived home tired. This time, however, we both felt great and glad to be home. By the next morning Dorothy felt so well that she started calling her friends. She must have called every friend she had, for it seemed that she was on the phone all day.<br><br>Her energy carried over until the next day. She seemed to have more pep than at any time since we had been making monthly trips to Zion, north of Chicago. We had been at this thing for about six months.<br><br>Despite my high hope of the past two days Dorothy’s energy began to sag during the afternoon. By early evening she couldn’t stay awake. I put her to bed with some difficulty, and I soon followed beside her. I must have slept pretty well, but when I looked at Dorothy she was in the same position as when I put her to bed. And I couldn’t wake her. I followed her ambulance to the hospital and hung around until they put her in a room where I could stay with her. I hoped that she would soon wake up and say something to me but she slept on. I left for meals and came right back, but nurses did not report any wakefulness. While I was home for lunch her second day there I had a call from the hospital. It was my neighbor who had stopped to see Dorothy and reported that she had just died. I found Dorothy’s sister Pat and husband Mike there when I returned. There was little else to do there except to say our goodbyes to Dorothy. She had died because the chemotherapy had destroyed her immune system.<br><br>Pat was a great help to me in making funeral arrangements, as were my children (Dorothy’s inherited family). The funeral took place at Market Street Presbyterian Church where we were members. It was a celebration of life. Many of Dorothy’s friends attended. Dick Sheffield, who conducted the service, said that it was the best attended funeral that he had conducted in his 18 years as pastor.<br><br>After the burial service my family and I went back to my house. We were talking about all kinds of things, including what I was going to do next. I got an urge to be alone for a little while and went out on my front porch to sit for a while. I had been dry-eyed throughout the ordeal. While I sat reflecting on the past few days I suddenly felt my throat tighten and tears flow from my eyes and down my cheeks. It was only then that I noticed that son David had joined me on the porch. It was then that I said, “I really did love that woman.” And I really meant it.	1	2017-04-22 18:48:56.698899	2017-04-23 00:12:22.098465	2012	1	\N	\N	\N	531	\N	\N
176	The Pet Cockroach	Retiring to my place of abode late one afternoon, I sat down in my easy chair for an after lunch siesta. My place is part of Catherine’s house, though it seems not so. It is a room set apart from the main part of the house, though sharing the roof and a common section of wall. A little porch, once occupied by the dog Jay, separates the room from the rest of the house, thus providing a bit of privacy and insulating it from sounds in the house, and vise versa. The porch faces the back yard which is home to Toy-Toy the orange tree, and closer in, a long-neglected bunch of overgrown sucker sprouts of crepe myrtle known to me as the trash tree. I maintain the tree deserves that name because it constantly drops leaves onto the patio table that sits under it, and its blossoms are so high one must strain his neck to see them.&nbsp;<br><br>When my eyes adjusted to the light in the room I noticed a black thumb-sized object on the floor, which I took to be a dead leaf from the trash tree tracked in by my unsuspecting foot. As I reached down to pick it up the darned thing moved. I realized at once that it was no leaf, but a cockroach, likely second only to the mosquito the world’s most despised insect. I have seen women in our kitchen turn vicious upon spying a brother to my visitor, removing a shoe and swatting mightily at it until a small pile of guts and eyes was left on the floor. I lifted my foot expecting to see a squirming degutted insect on the floor. Nothing. In inspected my shoe sole. Still nothing. A moment later the little varmint emerged from under my desk, stopped, looked my way and waved his antenna at me and after a brief pause, disappeared under some out of sight thing on the floor.<br><br>It was then that I remembered being awakened just a few nights ago by a flying object bouncing off the wall over my head and landing in my hair. I brushed it off with my hand and went back to sleep. It might have been a dream I thought; but now I was sure it had happened.&nbsp;<br><br>A few days later my little buddy showed himself again. He seemed to be shy, not coming to within my easy reach. Nevertheless he showed himself in several places, each time giving me a friendly wave of his antenna before exiting my view. In the following days he repeated his performance, coming ever closer to me, and I became accustomed to his antics. I decided to claim him as a pet since I had no other.<br><br>I made the mistake of telling Catherine of my pet. She came to visit me with a roach poison and hid it in a corner where I couldn’t see it. I saw only one roach performance after that. Evidently the poison food did its intended job. I expect my next encounter with my former pet will be a scene of a poor dead body lying on its back, legs extended skyward. Is it fair to deprive an old man of his odd pleasures?	1	2017-04-22 19:22:30.655677	2017-09-13 13:22:47.485356	2008	1	\N	\N	\N	555	\N	\N
79	The Robber Bird	A tiny bird about the size of one’s little finger spent the morning looking at flowers. He wasn’t admiring their beauty, or even their fragrance. He was most interested in the taste treat he could find hidden inside the bloom. He was perfectly designed for his mission. He was sleek in build and had a long narrow beak, just right to slip into the deep throat of a trumpet honeysuckle. His tongue was evidently made to suck the nectar from a flower like sipping soda through a straw.<br><br>Perhaps the colorful little bird had been luckless in finding his favorite flowers in his morning quest. Why else would he be attracted by a small bed of impatiens? They were of bright color and maybe he was not familiar with that flower. Despite the person sitting only a yard away from the flowers, the bird came close to examine the find.<br><br>There was no reason for a bird to be shy in the presence of a person. He had never been attacked by one. Besides that, a person moved much too slowly to catch him. He was of the perfect aerodynamic species. No other creature could maneuver so well. He could fly forward, backward, sideways, straight up or down, or hover like a balloon. The person would perceive him as one that could reverse directions without stopping and one that could stop without first slowing down.<br><br>The impatiens resided beside a porch where the person sat. A wrought iron banister enclosed the porch.&nbsp; An industrious spider had carefully selected a website at a corner of the banister, then spun a finely meshed web there.<br><br>The humming bird tested a blossom, hovering motionless except for the buzz of his wings. He backed up and tried another, and another until he had visited a dozen or so. He was about to buzz off in search of more productive flowers when he spied the spider’s work. He examined the web carefully and found many gnats imprisoned in it. He hovered near the web, eased forward and stole one of the spider’s catch. He backed off and savored the tidbit. The sample must have pleased him, for he repeated his performance again and again until he had robbed the spider of his entire catch. He checked the web to be sure there was nothing left, then in a twinkling of an eye he was gone, satisfied with his loot.&nbsp; The spider, however, was left with nothing. What was he to do except to get busy and repair his bare snare and wait in his lair?	1	2017-04-22 16:30:48.399463	2017-04-23 00:12:21.743354	2005	7	humming_bird.jpg	\N	\N	444	\N	\N
153	Dreams	Many times a day a freight train with twenty to twenty-five cars loaded to the brim and beyond with output from the coalfields just a few miles away, came up the hollow puffing tons of black smoke. My family lived across the narrow valley of the hollow from the railroad at the time when I was just learning to read. The loaded freights labored up the grade through the hollow at a speed that any able-bodied person could outrun. But the return trip was a different story; unloaded and down grade they seemed to fly past.<br><br>I was fascinated by the trains. I watched them go by and daydreamed that one day I could drive one of those trains. Oh, to be its engineer! Like many dreams, that one never came true.<br><br>At that time I also had night dreams. I walked along the railroad track, looking for whatever I could find of interest. Usually I found nothing, but nearly always when I was on the track I heard a train whistle. That warned me to get off the track, and I tried to step off the track and head to the right for home. That did no good for the track moved to the right along with my body. I heard the whistle, now closer. Maybe I could step off to the left, but again the track moved to the front of me and I could not get off the track. The whistle persisted getting closer as I ran down the track as fast as I could go. But we were headed down grade and there was no way I could stay ahead of the train. Fortunately I woke up before the train ran over me. I was mighty glad to wake up in my own bed. This dream is the one that I remember because it recurred often. Once my family moved away from the railroad the dream ceased.<br><br>Since then I have had many odd and some truly weird dreams, but all were since forgotten.<br><br>As an adult I suppose that I have had daydreams that I didn’t even realize that I had. But when I sit down and think about it there are thoughts that pass through my mind that can be classified as dreams. When I think of what is wrong with our society I think of the freedom that we have given up to our government. Our founding fathers believed that a republic could endure only so long as it has a strong moral fiber. It’s easy to blame bad politicians for bad government, but the people put them in office, and the same people can fire them. Therefore the ultimate responsibility for government, good or bad, belongs to the people.<br><br>The people who elect a representative have the responsibility to know if he does a proper job for his people, or for himself, and if for himself see that he is fired at the next election. Just don’t depend on what he says, only what he does.<br><br>My modern dream is on behalf of my grandchildren and great grandchildren. My dream is that enough of the people take seriously their worst enemy of freedom and downsize it before we lose our moral integrity.	1	2017-04-22 18:49:33.776989	2017-04-23 00:12:22.120805	2012	1	\N	\N	\N	555	\N	\N
161	Legacy	If someone asked me what I thought my legacy might someday be, I should answer that I had scarcely thought of such a thing. Of course I do wonder why anybody younger than my great grandchildren would have a single thought of me. Even the great grandsons who have seen me will not remember that notable occasion. Probably nobody will have heard of me. It could happen that a granddaughter will show her child a picture of me and say, “That’s your great granddaddy Jessee. You saw him when you were real little.”<br><br>It’s not likely that the granddaughter will hear the question, “What do you remember about him?”<br><br>Perhaps there are a few of my former peers, fellow engineers, who recall working on the Westinghouse team that kept us in the forefront of the industry in electric power systems for aircraft. There could be a few younger fellows who remember that I was the guy who wrote the annual “most meritorious patent disclosure” more times than anybody else. Those same younger guys would remember the “Jessee circuit”, so named by the manager of the Engineering Department for unknown reasons. I guessed that it was so that he could remember who to blame if it didn’t work. We were in the process of developing an electronic replacement for the mechanical constant speed drive. Our electronic replacement used power transistors, periodically switched on and off, so as to make an alternating current from a direct current source. The resulting output was good, and the frequency was constant, as desired. The flaw was that the time required for switching the transistors was variable. The “Jessee circuit” was a control device that corrected for these variations, thus eliminating undesirable harmonic distortion. My legacy among my former peers is limited to technical things and will not endure longer than my peers<br><br>The legacy I leave to my children will be the only one that matters to me. I hope it’s of good repute. Things I hear from them lead me to think that my reputation is all right. They all thank me for being a good parent and that they love me. That’s a good legacy in itself. They may recall that I selected a pew for the family close to the front. I told them the reason; everyone could see if they behaved properly. The only legacy I care about is that I was a pretty good daddy. The details of my legacy can be found only in the stories in my life writing. Because they are written they may survive my children and extend my legacy to those who care to read, even my grandchildren.	1	2017-04-22 18:59:58.536725	2017-04-23 00:12:22.176323	2013	1	\N	\N	\N	454	\N	\N
83	What's Money?	Money seemed to disappear when I was in second or third grade. Nobody I knew had any. People talked about having money before the Great Depression; so what happened to it? I didn’t have any idea, having had no experience with it. All I knew was that my daddy worked for it and that his job was eliminated and he moved the family across the mountain to Kentucky and left me with my grandparents so that I could finish third grade.<br><br>My introduction to money was by Grandma who out of the goodness of her heart one day gave me two fresh eggs that I could trade at the store for whatever I could get for them. The eggs were worth a nickel apiece so I loaded up on candy. Eggs worked as well as money, so no big deal so long as the hens kept on laying. Well, there was a disadvantage; a body could lose his money if he dropped it.<br><br>After I rejoined my family there were no more eggs but Daddy gave me a nickel now and then. I didn’t need money and I didn’t think much about it. Daddy worked for a while at the railroad passenger station selling tickets. One night he remarked that he sold a ticket for more than a hundred dollars.<br><br>“Wow! Were rich,” I said.<br><br>“No no, son, not quite. I only sold the ticket. The railroad gets the money,” said Daddy. I still had some things to learn about money. I learned a little more when Daddy bought a bicycle for me in the middle of the depression. It cost him a week’s pay. I learned even more as I tried to earn money to attend the 1935 Boy Scout Jamboree.<br><br>I was pretty sure that the government had taken the money when people were told to turn in all their gold coins. I remember that Momma had a gold dollar. She kept it. Good for her. We could still trade our paper money for silver. Money had some intrinsic value<br><br>Unfortunately the intrinsic value was not to last. Several years later the government stopped printing silver certificates and called in silver coins, substituting cheaper alloy ones. Money changed from gold and silver to debt; IOUs that is. That made it a lot easier for the government to insure inflation and print more IOUs. Our money would be completely worthless if there were no customers. There’s a lot more I don’t know about money but I believe an egg is still worth an egg.	1	2017-04-22 16:47:30.996905	2017-04-23 00:12:21.750138	2009	1	\N	\N	\N	443	\N	\N
85	Daddy and His Second Family	He was a slim, six-foot tall man with curly hair that never needed combing, or maybe always did. In his more than ninety years he never lost his curl that showed some gray only in his later years. A kind and shy guy who seldom raised his voice in anger, Isaac Jessee was reared on a southwestern Virginia hillside farm. Despite spending his entire working career as an office worker he never lost his agrarian character. Everywhere he lived he had a garden with vegetables, berries and flowers. He rented a house on a big lot that happened to have a barn in the back corner, and of course he bought a cow to occupy the barn.<br><br>This blue-eyed Mr. Jessee found his love; a blue-eyed school teacher with straight bobbed brown hair named Ivo Wells and married her in 1920. They moved their family to Pineville, Kentucky where they reared their three kids. They later moved to Middlesboro, Kentucky where they lived until Ivo’s death in 1959. Evidently he preferred married life to living alone and single. In the early 60’s he married Ruby, the widow of an old acquaintance.<br><br>Ruby lived in a small two-story house near the home of her mother, Mammy Yokum, and near others of Mammy’s clan. It was natural for the new couple to live in Ruby’s house. Ruby was a plain woman with fatty jowls and somewhat stringy gray hair. She never wore makeup, but she had an engaging smile that more than made up for no makeup. It was plain to see that she was mighty fond of Jessee.<br><br>Ruby was only part of a package deal in the marriage. With her came her dogs, the little yappy ones, Chihuahuas. They must have had half a dozen at one time. The runt named Baby (or was it Billy) was their favorite. When a non-family person entered the house a chorus of yapping prevailed for many minutes even when the dogs were removed to a remote location.<br><br>Ruby’s younger sister, Bertie, lived in a big stone house on a corner across the street from Ruby and Jessee. Although Bertie had many characteristics similar to her sister, she was much different. Bertie looked as if she spent some time at a beauty parlor. She had short wavy blonde hair and she wore makeup, perhaps more than necessary. Bertie was divorced and worked for a lawyer in Pineville, the county seat. She drove 13 miles across Log Mountain each day to work. She was good at her job. She must have spent much of her free time at antique or rummage sales. Her big stone house was furnished almost entirely with antique furniture, all of good quality. The house on a lot sloping upward from the street was unique. It was built by an old German man from rounded stones gathered from creek beds, fitted together and secured by concrete. The house conformed to the slope of the land, the kitchen and dining room on the lower level and the living room and bedrooms on the higher. Surrounded by trees and shrubs, the house was not evident from the street.&nbsp;<br><br>Bertie evidently didn’t spend very much time at her house. She usually stopped in at the Jessee’s for the evening. They and their dogs became a close-knit family. Jessee busied himself in maintaining the house and grounds of both houses and tending his gardens. He was always proud of his flowers and his vegetables. He made many innovations that few others would have thought of. Ruby took care of most of the housekeeping chores.<br><br>Bertie didn’t like the idea of sleeping alone in the stone house and eventually moved in with the Jessee’s. The arrangement<br><br>worked well for them, at least for a while. Even after Ruby died Bertie stayed to look after the old man that both women thought of as the best and kindest man they had ever known.<br><br>Bertie’s absence from her house proved profitable for burglars. Word got around the burgling community of the easy touch. The theft continued until the only things of value left in the house were too heavy to be moved without real work. What burglar wants work? Police were never able to find the burglars or their loot.<br><br>There’s no doubt that Bertie enjoyed tracking down and buying antiques and rummage sale clothes. She had a room full of high quality dresses that she never got to wear. Unfortunately neither did anyone else. The whole lot was infested with barely visible little brown roaches that ate little holes in the fabric.<br><br>The pity of her life was that she got so little use of her big stone house full of antiques and fine clothes. Instead she found joy in association with her loved ones.	1	2017-04-22 16:48:56.368569	2017-04-23 00:12:21.757155	2009	4	\N	\N	\N	830	\N	\N
86	Scenes from My Annapolis Sojourn	Prolog: The tranquil place that Kim envisioned was not available to me. Nevertheless I found a relatively quiet place to let my mind wander and it settled on nothing profound. So I just wrote what came to mind.<br><br>Business flourished at Westinghouse Aerospace Division when aircraft companies were building new airplanes. When both military and commercial airplane business slumped, so did ours. Both businesses slumped in about 1985. Rather than lay off people management arranged for a few of us to temporarily transfer to the Marine Division in Annapolis, Maryland where the plant is located at the water’s edge on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay. Charlie Doughman and I were among the lucky ones to go. The good news was that we could travel home every other weekend. Charlie went first, rented an apartment and got acquainted with the area, making it much easier for me when I showed up.<br><br>At the workplace I was assigned a desk. Somebody gave me some reading material to acquaint me with the marine business. The desk was located in one of many cubicles set in a big office. Inside my cubicle I could see no one else in the room but I could easily hear voices, especially in the hallway just across the wall. I felt like I was boxed up and ready for shipping once some one nailed the lid on my box. I soon settled down to read the stuff I was given.&nbsp;<br><br>“Want to go out for lunch?” came a voice from across the wall. It wasn’t just a strange voice. It was a very familiar voice. It sounded exactly like George; but it couldn’t be. I went back to my reading. Soon I heard Otto say something but he’s not here either. The distraction of hearing these voices made it impossible to concentrate on my reading, so I just sat there and listened. After a few more strange voices I heard yet another familiar voice. This pattern continued for the rest of the day. It was a most eerie feeling and for a moment I thought I had never left home.<br><br>I don’t know if we helped the Marine Division. I can’t even recollect what I worked on. I did remember that when near the Chesapeake Bay one must eat seafood. We enjoyed the meals of oysters fixed four different ways. One night Charlie and I went to a restaurant on the eastern shore where we lived. We ordered a platter of blue point crabs in the shell. When the order arrived I was aghast at the size of the serving. The platter was a foot and a half in diameter and stacked in a mound that was ready to become an avalanche. This was my first try at picking meat from a crab shell. It took a while to get the hang of it but we persisted. They tasted too good to give up. When we finished the platter an hour or so later we were still hungry so we ordered another that we finished in another hour. That was some mighty fine eating. We could have eaten more but after two hours of picking out the meat we were simply too tired to continue.<br><br>Occasionally Charlie and I spent a day in Washington visiting some of the attractions. It was an easy trip. Charlie drove his Toyota to the nearest station where he parked it and we took the Metro into the city. One spring day we emerged from the Metro hole in the ground and after strolling about for a few minutes spied some of the famous Japanese cherry trees in bloom. The scene looked so inviting that we were drawn to wander over for a closer look. It was a warm day, slightly overcast but not threatening with only a slight breeze. Presently we found ourselves in the midst of a pink enchanted world, far removed from the city where we had been only moments before. As I walked leisurely along a path I found myself glancing at tree trunks as if expecting a character I had heard about in a long forgotten fairy tale to peep out at me. The absence of crisp shadows gave the forest of flowers a soft glow and caused in me a feeling of well-being. Whatever else we did that day paled in comparison to the walk among the cherry trees.<br><br>My Annapolis sojourn was an interesting one but I was glad when my stint was done and I could get back to my unfinished projects.	1	2017-04-22 16:49:45.119903	2017-04-23 00:12:21.764135	2009	6	\N	\N	\N	778	\N	\N
87	The Miner's Wife	A valley in the hollow lay between a pair of partially cleared ridges that retained woods at their crests. Along the east side of the valley a pike gave access to the residents of Bum Holler. Along the ridge to the west lay the tracks of the Southern Railroad that hauled coal from the fields some twelve to fifteen miles away. The mammoth steam locomotives labored to pull twenty to twenty-five cars loaded with coal up the grade through the hollow.<br><br>A person running alongside a loaded train could easily keep up with it. Many depression-era hobos took advantage of the grade to get a free ride to somewhere. Some local men boarded a slow train<br><br>to throw off a few lumps of coal that he would later put in a sack and carry home to fuel his stove.<br><br>Bum Holler had changed a little during my first eight years of life. It had grown from three houses along a mile of road to four before the 1929 stock market crash. Its new owners, Bonnie and her husband Hudsle, occupied the new house that I had watched with great interest while it grew from just a few piles of planks and stuff.<br><br>Hudsel lost his job after the crash and took a job in the coal mines. He didn’t like working in the mines. Freeing the coal from the underground deposits and loading it onto the tramcars in areas where he could not stand erect was a grimy job. Once out of the mine at the end of his shift he needed to shower and change cloths before heading home. It was a dirty and dangerous job but it afforded him a much needed income. It was men like Hudsel that enabled the freight trains to puff their way through Bum Holler.<br><br>The day started like most any other day early in the depression. Those who still had jobs left for work as usual and the farmers went about their farming duties.<br><br>When he’d finished milking the cows my youngest uncle drove the cows from the barn to pasture. Then he split wood for the cook stove and finished a few other chores before he set out on foot for the village of East Stone Gap where unemployed guys gathered to deliver the latest news and gossip from around the area. In those days there were no telephones in Bum Holler and few in towns. The local newspaper was published only weekly; so the guy’s were the best source of news around. I believe the Hudsels had a radio but it was battery powered and was therefore played sparingly; besides, there was no local station nearby.<br><br>About noon some of the guys left their gathering and went home for dinner. So it was that word spread that an accident happened in one of the mines but nobody knew which mine was affected. According to reports some miners were trapped inside the mine and rescue operations were underway. When the news reached Bum Holler all her neighbors thought of how Bonnie must feel. No doubt she was worried about her husband. Ivo who was my mother and Bonnie’s cousin, went down to see if she could be of any comfort.<br><br>“It’s a terrible thing about the mine accident.” Ivo said, “Was Hudsel working today?”<br><br>“He went to wark this morning. I’m so worried about him.”<br><br>“Where does he work?”<br><br>“I,m not sure. He’’d been at Arno but he mentioned that he might be transferred to Andover. I just don’t know if he moved yet.”<br><br>“We don’t know where the accident happened. There are half a dozen other places it could be. I wouldn’t worry. It’s not likely it was his mine.”<br><br>“I know but I can’t help but worry about him. I feel so bad about the trapped men whether Hud is one of them or not.”<br><br>“So do I. Let’s hope and pray that Hud’s not hurt.”<br><br>The hours crept by as the tension mounted in Bonnie’s mind and body no word came about the location of the accident. At Ivo’s urging Bonnie started fixing supper, more to keep busy than merely to prepare a meal.<br><br>“I just don’t know what I’ll do if anything happened to him,” sobbed Bonnie.<br><br>“Let’s wait a while before worrying about what to do,” consoled Ivo.<br><br>The hour of Hudsel’s usual arrival finally came. Bonnie looked anxiously down the road from the front porch. She started pacing the floor and finally sat down for a moment but she was soon up pacing again. Half an hour passed before a car stopped in front of the house and Hudsel got out. Bonnie greeted him with an adoring hug.<br><br>“I’m so glad to see you!” said Bonnie.<br><br>“Wow, glad to see you too. Sorry to be so late. There was an accident at the Rhoda mine. The road was full of machines that made it slow going to get through, but we made it,” Hudsel said with a smile.&nbsp;<br><br>“There were some men trapped inside but the rescue team will get them out all right.”	1	2017-04-22 16:50:20.889448	2017-04-23 00:12:21.776872	2009	1	\N	\N	\N	914	\N	\N
89	Mary's House	After ten years in our new house it wasn’t new any more. We had shrubs and flowers about, and a tree grew in the front yard. I had finished a room in the attic for two growing boys and one room remained unfinished. Since the boys occupied the upstairs room it seemed reasonable to provide them a bathroom near their sleeping quarters and so I had a dormer added to the back of the house with toilet and bath facilities installed. I thought the house was adequate for our family of six, but the children were growing and we could use a little more room. And so it was that Mary kept an eye open for something more appropriate for the family.<br><br>It came to pass that she found a house for sale in a long settled part of town among other large houses. It was on a quiet street near Faurot Park. Of course we had to go look at the house. It was more than adequate for our family and the price seemed more than adequate as well. The house with window shutters that no longer worked sat back of a small front yard, a hedge on one side, a driveway on the other. The back yard was a three-tiered area with ample lilacs, peonies, trees and a garage.<br><br>Entrance was gained from a stoop with its own roof to an area with the living room to the left and the stairway to the right. The stairs, living room and adjacent dining room were all covered by a rich burgundy colored carpet. Access to the kitchen from the dining room was through a small butler’s pantry. A breakfast nook and a mudroom type back porch flanked the kitchen. A screened-in porch abutted the living room. Three bedrooms and a bathroom were upstairs. The master bedroom with bath was huge, extending the full length of the front of the house. Besides all this were a finished attic and a three-room basement housing an old-fashioned, gravity-operated hot air furnace, modified for gas. There was more, but what else could one want. Mary loved the house and it was plain to see she had her heart set on it.<br><br>The owner had acquired the house hoping to make a profit. I thought he might settle for less profit than he hoped for. Mary and I mulled over the situation. We’d have to go through the hassle of selling our house and get a new loan, increasing our debt. I learned from my father to abhor debt. Nevertheless we decided how much debt we could tolerate and to make an offer.<br><br>Although I liked the house, Mary, being much more interested than I, took it upon herself to keep track of negotiations. She seemed very optimistic that we would get the house. As days passed she was bubbly and happy. Everything was going very well—until one day when I came home from work to find her in tears.<br><br>“I’m so miserable”, she said, “Somebody has made a better offer on our house”.<br><br>“It’s not our house,” I said, “Did somebody buy the house?”<br><br>“No, but things looked so good yesterday.”<br><br>“Don’t fret, all is not lost. Tomorrow we’ll go look at other houses,” I said, trying to consol her.<br><br>Mary, her bubbly spirit dampened, kept track of the negotiations for the next week or two. Finally she told me the owner had made a new proposal. Evidently the higher bidder couldn’t make the down payment for a loan.<br><br>“He’ll take our house with its mortgage as part payment for his house,” she said.<br><br>“Good, then maybe we can afford it.”<br><br>“But there’s a catch,” she said, “You have to finish the other attic room.”<br><br>“OK,” I groaned and set to work on the weekend. I bought and installed the wallboard, finished the floor and did the necessary painting. It turned out to be more work than I wanted but I eventually finished and we moved into our new abode. We were welcomed by new neighbors and settled in to make the house a comfortable home for the rest of Mary’s life.	1	2017-04-22 16:52:05.720757	2017-04-23 00:12:21.783744	2009	4	\N	\N	\N	727	\N	\N
84	Brother	Jim Harp reported for football practice along with several other freshmen. It was an exciting day for most of the boys. There was hope of making the team in a year or two and they were willing to practice with the bigger boys to learn the skills necessary to play the game. I’m sure that Jim had the same hopes and ambition. But there was one difference in Jim that that set him apart in the minds of football fans and others. He was the younger brother of Red Harp the team’s star quarterback of the recent past.<br><br>Red had been a better than average player. He could do everything a quarterback was expected to do. He was a triple-threat player, able to run, pass, and kick. He could run like the wind and evade tacklers like no one else on the team. Red’s most memorable play resulted from a mistake. His team had the ball on its own two- yard line. It was an obvious punting situation. Red was standing only a yard from the in-bounds line ready to punt when the pass from the center missed its target and Red had to step to one side to catch the ball. It was too late for him to reposition himself and kick the ball. Red managed to avoid the opposing linemen and head up field where he faked his way past linebackers then outran the safety. The touchdown resulted from a 109-yard run, a conference record.<br><br>Jim turned out to be a good football player but never equaled his brother as a player. I’ve wondered if the shadow of his brother somehow affected his attitude and his game.<br><br>I have known brothers who seemed to fight each other nearly all the time. They seemed to never get along. But on the other hand if either saw his brother in trouble he was always there to defend him. Is that what they mean by brotherly love?<br><br>I had a brother but he didn’t seem like a brother. He was born when I was twelve years old and we had little in common. I knew him as a baby. He was a pretty little fellow. By the time he started to school I was off at college and had little contact with him while he was growing up. He married very young and soon moved to California. I lost track of him for many years. It was only when my sister settled Daddy’s estate that we got together after the long absence. I’m thankful that we finally got acquainted, even if in our old age. He died only a couple years later. I’d liked to have known him better.<br><br>Evidently the word brother can induce many different images in the minds of people and it doesn’t always involve a blood relationship. The term “Big Brother” as portrayed in Huxley’s book “1984” where Big Brother is everywhere comes to mind. He is always watching so that there is no privacy and no originality of thought. “Just do as I say and you’ll be taken care of.”<br><br>Of course Big Brother was a fictional character created in the mind of the author of the book. Maybe so, but an awareness of our government’s action in recent days makes one think that he is much closer to reality than most people believe. A few examples may be in order.<br><br>Congress passed a law banning the sale of incandescent light bulbs after a certain date. Instead those little curly fluorescents made with mercury are all right, until you break one. Who do you call to clean up the hazard?<br><br>There are those in government who want to limit the maximum a company can pay an employee in addition to the minimum.<br><br>They want to restrict the car you can drive, have a bureaucrat determine your health care, and on and on, and on.<br><br>The President has even proposed a “smart meter’’ for each house to remind us dummies that the shower is taking too long, or that the thermostat in set too high or too low, or maybe it’s time to go to bed. I guess we are all dummies.<br><br>Add to these examples all the freedoms we have lost through restrictions and taxes and Big Brother seems very close indeed.<br><br>The concept of brother can bring thoughts of many things from love to competition to serfdom.<br><br>AFTERWORD: If you have never seen the movie “Oh Brother Where Are’t Thou” then do so. You will enjoy it.	1	2017-04-22 16:48:07.117246	2017-04-23 00:12:21.790461	2009	8	\N	\N	Non-Fiction	792	Late	\N
88	Bad News	We’d had a good life together, Mary and me. From cutting wedding cake, to getting up in the middle of the night to attend to sick kids, to seeing four of them through high school we’d been a functional family. We had agreed or agreed to disagree on things that mattered. Our love for each other had grown and matured. At this time in our lives we were ready to begin to enjoy the fruits of our labors. It was late winter 1973. She was only 46 and I just 52. Shouldn’t we have a lot of years to enjoy the fruits of our labors together?<br><br>But it was not to be. It was a dreary winter day when I came home from the hospital where the doctor had found that her cancer had spread and riddled her liver with tumors. The chemotherapy had done no good. That dreary day was the darkest day of my life. In my heart Mary died that day. Alone in bed that night I shed bitter tears and many sobs before I finally slept. Morning brought no relief. It was the beginning of my grief cycle. I was angry, sad, seeking whom or what to blame for her illness, sorry for myself and all the other negative things that goes with grief. I continued in my grief for the few months left of her mortal life. By that time my grief had pretty much run its course and I felt a sense of relief that Mary’s discomfort and suffering were at an end.<br><br>When we first learned of Mary’s illness of course I was concerned and realized that a long struggle lay ahead for her. In her first stint in the hospital the doctors found cancer in her colon. They removed a section of the colon and scheduled chemotherapy for her. She recovered from the surgery in good spirits. She had many friends who came to her with support and encouragement. In the spirit of the Christmas season some of them had a party for her in the hospital. They even brought her a three-foot tree, complete with decorations.<br><br>Mary was discharged from the hospital shortly before Christmas and so spent her last one at home with her family. The kids got a family sized pine tree for the occasion and we celebrated Yuletide almost as usual, but with an air of foreboding.<br><br>In the days that followed I was optimistic about her recovery. I believed that she would get well. Frequently a group of friends came to the house to visit Mary. They often prayed over her with laying on of hands and anointing her with oil. She functioned much as normal, though a little slower. I continued to have what I thought was faith, but as I saw her health decline day by day I realized that it was only hope, not faith. Then on that dreary late winter day even my hope was dashed on the rocks of reality.<br><br>Friends continued to visit, to sometimes bring food, to talk, to pray, and bolster her spirit even as her body shrank to skin and bones. She began to accumulate fluid in the belly so that she looked pregnant and meant a trip to the doctor to drain the fluid. The fluid contained protein that was supposed to nourish her body. The resulting reduction in weight was a relief, making it easier for her to move around.<br><br>Memory does not serve me well concerning this period of my life. Perhaps it’s a normal thing for the mind to shut out the most painful experiences.&nbsp;	1	2017-04-22 16:51:11.106004	2017-04-23 00:12:21.797269	2009	5	\N	\N	Non-Fiction	620	Middle	\N
169	What's for Lunch?	“We’ve done pretty well this morning,” Dick said as he put his folder back into his file cabinet, “I suggest we knock off for lunch now and come back and finish up after we eat. Does anyone have a preference where we go?”<br><br>“It’s your town, so you pick the place,” George said.<br><br>“Good, I know a place near here where you don’t have to settle for burgers and fries or the blue plate special.”  It was a short drive to Dick’s chosen place for lunch. It looked like an ordinary place; nothing fancy about it. We were seated without delay though there was no lack of customers. In addition to many items regularly found on lunch menus there were some strange things listed. I don’t remember specific things but foreign sounding names and wild game were on the menu. I have no idea why but a single item caught my eye, cannibal sandwich.<br><br>All kinds of weird thoughts must have gone through my head. I could have consulted my host or even a waiter as to the nature of the cannibal sandwich, but no, I was embarrassed to show my ignorance about such matters.&nbsp;<br><br>Judging from its name it could be a sandwich made from or for cannibals. I was pretty sure that it did not contain cannibal meat, but that was about all I was reasonably sure of. My acquaintance with cannibals was limited to cartoons and puzzles about cannibals and missionaries. The cartoons show a missionary in a huge pot of water over a flaming fire with of course a cannibal with a bone in his hair nearby. The puzzle involves a boat that can ferry only three people in each trip across the river, and the missionaries must never be in the minority lest they be eaten by the cannibals. What could a cannibal sandwich be like? The only way to find out I thought was to order one, so I did.<br><br>While I waited for my order I wondered what it would be like, and if I could really eat it. After waiting long enough I was rewarded with my sandwich. It was a beautiful thing. There on a cold plate was a patty of ground red meat right out of the refrigerator, sandwiched between a slice of bread on the plate and a raw egg on top. I gazed at it for a full minute or maybe two before I decided that the red meat had to be beef from a cow or a steer. With a bit of salt and pepper I ate the whole thing, though I would have preferred it hot rather than cold. A great consolation was the beer that finished my meal.&nbsp;	1	2017-04-22 19:20:21.628495	2017-04-23 00:12:22.20278	2012	1	\N	\N	\N	470	\N	\N
103	Bedtime Story	“The Bakers are having an Easter egg hunt this afternoon in their backyard and they invited me. May I go?” Fred asked his mother.<br><br>“How will you get there?” she asked.<br><br>“I’ll walk, it’s on the other side of the woods. It won’t take long,” he said. The Bakers lived about a mile down the road from Fred’s house. Fred was used to walking places alone even as a six-year-old. That’s how he got to school.<br><br>“All right, but be back before supper,” his mother said.<br><br>After lunch Fred called his dog, Jake, and they soon started off to hunt eggs with a dozen other children. As they walked along the road next to a woods Jake spied a rabbit beside the road. Jake couldn’t restrain himself and took off like a shot after the bunny, which dashed into the woods with Jake following close behind. Fred’s calls to Jake went unanswered and Fred continued on to the Baker’s without Jake.<br><br>The Baker’s back yard was a huge one with lots of shrubs, trees, flowers and many places to hide eggs. There was a play area with swings and a slide and even a doghouse. So several children were already assembled when Fred arrived but no sign of Jake. It was a fine spring Saturday afternoon and the children were anxious to get started. Mrs. Baker soon came out with a handful of bags, the kind with loop handles, and passed them out. After a few instructions, she blew a whistle to start the game and the children were off in a flash looking for the hidden eggs.<br><br>There were many screams of delight and a few groans as somebody heard a crunching sound under foot, the sound of a broken egg. The hunt went on for an hour or so with boys and girls loudly announcing where they found a brightly colored egg. Fred had seven in his bag before he quit the hunt. Mrs. Baker soon called off the hunt by bringing out ice cream and cake.<br><br>“This is good stuff,” said the girl sitting next to Fred, “And just think, we’ll have an Easter feast tomorrow.”<br><br>”What are you having? I don’t care what we’re having. I just can’t wait to see what the Easter Bunny leaves for me. Chocolate bunnies I hope. I just love chocolate,” Fred said.<br><br>“My daddy said we’re having rabbit stew," the girl said as she finished her last bite of cake and got up to leave.<br><br>Fred thanked his hostess and left the party. As he left he decided to take a shortcut through the woods to home. He came to a fork in the trail. He stopped to think of which way to go. He followed his choice for a way but didn’t see anything familiar but he plodded on. After walking farther than the trail home should be he came again to a fork in the trail. Now he was lost and didn’t know how to get back to where he started. He sat down to figure it out. Just when he thought he was lost without hope he heard a sound behind him in the brush. That raised the hair on his neck; but before he could die of fright something cold touched his neck where the hair stood erect. Before he could pick himself up off the ground a familiar warm wet tongue slid across his face.<br><br>“Jake! Where have you been? Boy, am I glad to see you. Let’s go home.” Fred got to his feet and followed Jake home. Fred had taken a loop trail at the fork and ended up at the fork where he made the wrong choice.<br><br>Safe at home Fred had no appetite for supper. Too much ice cream and cake? His mother noticed a tear in his eye as she tucked him into bed. “Mommy, a girl at the party said they are having Easter Bunny stew for dinner tomorrow,” Fred moaned.<br><br>“Maybe so, but they’ll have to catch him first,” said Mommy, “go to sleep now and don’t worry.” He did go to sleep—after worrying for quite a while.<br><br>Easter morning came and Fred awoke sooner than anyone else. When Mommy finally came out to make some coffee the first thing she noticed was a half-eaten chocolate bunny.	1	2017-04-22 17:07:35.284152	2017-06-09 17:24:46.510819	2009	1	\N	\N	Fiction	767	Early	Story
102	Letter to Mary	Dear Mary,<br><br>It has been a long, long time since we reveled in our passion for each other. The memories of our good times together have to a large extent faded from my mind. Now and then a scene from our past forms in my brain that reminds me of how good things were for us. The politically correct speak of old age as the golden years. Hogwash! I see the golden years as the years we had together as a family, especially those before our kids became teenagers smarter than their parents, but even those years with their challenges were mainly good ones.<br><br>Even though my claim that I married you to get a good mother-in-law may have contained a grain of truth, that was far from the whole truth. I admired you very much. Your values were on the right track and your personality complemented my own. I don’t know for sure but I may have really loved you. At the time I was sure that I was in love with you. You must have loved me a little because you stayed with me while learning to cope with an unfamiliar lifestyle. Love is not a static thing. It either grows or fades and I am grateful that ours grew stronger.<br><br>My love for you grew because you were a great companion, a good mother to the children and I felt your love for me respecting my decisions. We were able to settle our differences without malice.<br><br>I always admired your courage. You took on the job of getting prepared to train Girl Scout leaders. You confronted the owner of the local newspaper face to face when you thought him wrong about public education. You joined three other women to help children learn to read by trying to get a phonics based reading program into the school system.<br><br>I am grateful that you were able to be the steering force of our family life until the children became adults. I deeply regret that you and I together were not allowed to enjoy the fruits of our labor. I believe that for the most part you would be proud of your children and their offspring were it not for that most dreaded of all diseases.<br><br>Know that my love for you still lives in my heart.<br><br>Honey&nbsp;<br><br>P.S. You probably don’t care about this nor do I but I’ve been asked to write a description of what I saw on the top of my mother’s dresser. It has been seventy years since I saw her dresser. I don’t remember the dresser, much less what was on it. I would venture a guess. The dresser had some drawers was made of oak and had a three-foot long mirror mounted at the rear. It likely had a scarf covering most of the top. There lay on that a comb and hairbrush, maybe some hairpins and some skin cream. You fill in the rest.	1	2017-04-22 17:06:40.425484	2017-08-08 20:34:53.847024	2009	7	\N	\N	Non-Fiction	515	Middle	Letter
107	Winter Wonderland?	Southern Louisiana, January, Twenty-ten: Since just a few days past New Years Day it seems that I can’t get warmed up. I heard many warnings on the radio to protect the plants, and it became wrap your water pipes with anything including newspapers, old tee-shirts, diapers or anything else that might insulate them from the cold. I heard things that I’d never have heard in January in Ohio where I lived before I moved to Louisiana. All this kind of thing would have been taken care of months earlier.<br><br>Before the month was much older I realized that the warnings were serious. We had three or four nights in a row when the temperature dropped to less than twenty degrees. Just before the drop there was much scurrying around at our house to save the potted plants and to make a bed inside for the dog that usually resides outdoors.<br><br>News from around the country reported hundreds of new low-temperature records set, not to mention the blizzards and deep snows.<br><br>Unless my imagination is running wild I remember that for several years we’ve been bombarded with warnings that the earth is afflicted with global warming and that we the people had better shape up or we would be drowned in ocean water raised by melting glaciers, and that there would be no more of those darling polar bears. Of course the reason must be our own fault, according to those who stand to make their fortunes from burning carbon.<br><br>Supposing that the globe is really warming, regardless of the hoax being perpetuated by the carbon propagandists, shouldn’t we be joyful for it? Just think what the weather might be without it. The highs, rather than the lows might be in the twenties, and the ground frozen solid. The semitropical plants would be destroyed. Should it be true, I should say “Hooray for global warming.”	1	2017-04-22 17:50:17.269599	2017-04-23 00:12:21.820818	2010	1	\N	\N	\N	326	\N	\N
108	Tybrisa Beach	It seems odd to me to head west when our destination is east, but that’s how it was. Daughter Catherine and I left for Savannah via Houston on Saturday morning. Much earlier that day son David left northern Virginia in his car for the Savannah airport. He arrived shortly after we did, and after an impromptu tour of Savannah where we accidentally nearly crashed a wedding in one of Savannah’s many parks, made our way on to Tybee Island. Being first to arrive at Tybrisa Beach Resort we had our choice of beds.<br><br>Sunday morning found David, who turned out to be our official shuttle driver, hustling back to the airport to fetch his brother Stephen. Later in the day Susanna and husband Dick drove in from Florida. All my children and a spouse were assembled in one place. Needless to say the rest of the day was spent catching up on everyone’s recent activities.<br><br>It was Labor Day weekend and a large crowd of holiday revelers filled the beach parking lot early in the day. There was a steady stream of cars touring the lot, looking for a parking place. Few found one, but some had come to enjoy the beach for a while and left, making room for latecomers. Nevertheless the stream continued until nightfall when the music in the nearby pavilion became much louder. At a bit past nine o’clock the music stopped and fireworks launched from the long pier jutting out over the ocean to a fishing platform began their show. Many oohs and ahs were uttered from our group of watchers when a rocket burst into a colorful array of brief points of light in the sky. We watched with delight until the show ended and the music resumed. We felt good to have watched the fireworks from the best of vantage points and to get home by just walking back inside.<br><br>There was no way to keep Dick out of the kitchen. He loves to cook for a gang of hungry folks. We ate well during our stay. He was in the kitchen helping out even when someone else was fixing the meal.<br><br>The Labor Day crowd was much diminished from the previous day and family members leisurely visited the beach to enjoy the sand and the surf. Even I managed a trip to the beach although I usually read a recorded book while they strolled the beach. Catherine liked to watch sunrise over the ocean and take pictures as the sun rose. She got some nice pictures but was disappointed in not finding the spectacular sunrise she hoped for.<br><br>Wednesday was a busy day for our shuttle driver. Granddaughter Ursula arrived early; Stephen left at midday and Ursula’s new boy friend Alex came at suppertime. Dick helped by making one of the trips to the airport<br><br>Overall our gathering was a pleasant and fulfilling experience, but for me a trip to Tybrisa Beach is always a bittersweet experience. The place was my late wife Dorothy’s favorite spot. In my mind’s eye I can see her on the beach, surrounded by all of the gulls in the neighborhood, enticed there by her bag of breadcrumbs. I can see the two of us sitting in a beach swing, watching the people pass by. I can see her walking in the surf, being careful that the water is only ankle deep. I can see during our last trip there the scene on TV when checking the weather channel. Instead of the weather report, the horrible scene of collapsing buildings came into view.&nbsp;<br><br>I know it’s hard to believe but nobody turned on the TV while we were there this year.

110	Swing	“Key word: swing.” Write a story about swings? We did write about porches and that turned out all right, but swings? Well, I thought about the key word and looked it up in the dictionary. It took half a page to tell me about the word. Didn’t Kim mention something about subplots? What’s written here may be nothing but subplots if any plot at all.<br><br>My first recollection of “swing” is from Uncle Billy’s sitting room on a Sunday afternoon when I was very young. There was nothing for a young fellow to do but sit with the old folks while they talked and the clock ticked off the seconds to the swing of the clock’s pendulum which swung ever more slowly as the day passed.<br><br>I learned more about our key word back home when I disobeyed my daddy. He had a peach tree in the yard that provided him with more than ample means of delivering what he called peach tree tea. His delivery system was simple. He broke off a small switch and with a couple of swings he applied the tea to my bare legs [I hated shorts]. It took only two or three swings to enhance my memory. I don’t like to admit it, but I deserved the tea he served.<br><br>I learned the picture that most readily comes to mind with the word “swing” at the home of one of my country cousins. There, hanging from a branch of a tall tree, was a pair of ropes spaced a few feet apart and reaching to knee-high from the ground with a plank seat attached to the ends of the ropes. It was pure delight to sit in the swing and ride to and fro feeling the breeze thus created on a hot day. A little later in life I discovered similar swings in playgrounds.<br><br>In 1930 I learned that there were swings in the economy when Daddy lost his job three times and ended up in another state. The swing turned out to be a really big one; swinging into the Great Depression and taking a war to swing it back out.<br><br>I believe the war caused the near demise of the porch swing. Before the war almost all houses had front porches. Most houses built afterwards had no front porch and therefore no place for a swing. That’s a shame because it tended to isolate neighbors from one another.&nbsp;<br><br>Not far from our high school there was a sandwich shop with booths around a small dance floor with a jukebox. Some of the high school kids were usually there after school snacking and dancing. The time was during the big band era. Big band swing tunes played on the jukebox for a nickel and the dancers responded with their swing dancing. I sometimes stopped by to see what was going on. I couldn’t dance and so I watched with envy. On my way home I would frequently swing around the block just to see if a certain girl might be sitting in her porch swing and I could stop for a little visit. I was usually disappointed by seeing the empty swing.<br><br>There were no trips to the sandwich shop for me during football season. The team practiced until nearly dark every day. It may be hard to believe, but I played tackle for the Pineville Mountain Lions. We were leading 6 to 0 in the big game versus the Corbin Red Dogs. The crowd was very happy that we, the underdogs, were doing well. It was Corbin’s ball and they called a running play. Both our left end and I broke through their line and hit the ball carrier at the same time from opposite sides. Our momentum swung my teammate and me feet first toward one another. The resulting collision between his heel and my shinbone ended my football career by breaking the leg. The mood of the crowd swung from light-hearted to reserved at least for a while. Our team won the game and the conference championship.<br><br>I saw many swinging bridges in my young life. There were short ones across creeks and long ones that spanned rivers. Swinging bridges are usually footbridges suspended from a pair of cables spanning a crossing. Walking across a swinging bridge can feel like walking on a living thing. Put down a foot and the floor is not where it ought to be. This is especially true if there are other walkers on the bridge. One of my occasional dreams was about walking across a swinging bridge. I never made it to the other side before waking up.<br><br>I’ve mentioned a few of my childhood encounters with “swing”. As I grew older there were many more swings in my life; swings in mood, attitude, fortune, responsibility, happiness, grief and lots of other things. Maybe I have swung into old age, but I doubt it. I think old age just crept up on me.	1	2017-04-22 17:51:29.665452	2017-04-23 00:12:21.843124	2010	1	\N	\N	\N	857	\N	\N
111	Stealing Apples	Twelve-year-old Jack and his little brother Tom, a couple years younger, had been fishing in the creek most of the morning. Now they were on their way home and they were hungry for lunch. It was a fine clear day in early fall. The fishing had been fun but the few fish they caught were tossed back into the creek because they were too little to keep.&nbsp;<br><br>Presently they came upon Mr. Miller’s apple orchard. The trees were a beautiful sight, loaded with bright shiny red fruit just right for picking.&nbsp;<br><br>“Lets see if we can reach over the fence and pick some apples. They look like Jonathans, my favorite,” said Jack. He tried but the trees were all too far back from the fence.<br><br>“Maybe you could climb over the fence,” suggested Tom.<br><br>“Maybe,” said Jack and before he could think it through he was climbing the fence. Jack found some beautiful low-hanging fruit and was about to pick one when---<br><br>“Look out! There comes a huge cow,” yelled Tom.<br><br>Forgetting the apples, Jack looked around and said, “That’s no cow. That’s a bull, and he does not look friendly.”<br><br>“Up the tree!” said Tom, as Jack scrambled up out of the bull’s reach.<br><br>What the boys failed to realize was that the orchard was at the end of a pasture where the bull (a daddy cow) had been feeding on grass during the day where the fence enclosed both the pasture and the orchard. The bull was not interested in the apples, but was free to move among the trees. He must have noticed the disturbance and come to check it out. Did he think he was a watchdog?<br><br>The bull stood under Jack’s chosen tree, looking up at Jack now and then and pawing the ground once in a while. He didn’t seem to want to move on; he just hung around there. Jack was trapped in the tree and didn’t know what to do. Sweat poured down his face as he wished he had not climbed the fence. After what seemed a long, long time Jack had an idea.<br><br>“Tom, take off your shirt.”<br><br>“Huh?”<br><br>“Take off your shirt and wave it over the fence. Get the bull’s attention, and move away from me, waving the shirt. Maybe he’ll follow you.” Tom did as Jack said but the bull didn’t seem to notice. Tom came closer to the bull and tried again. This time the bull looked at the waving shirt and stepped toward it. As Tom moved away from Jack, the bull followed. As the bull began to catch up with Tom, he ran faster and finally pulled his shirt back over to his side of the fence.<br><br>“Get out now,” said Tom as Jack jumped to the ground and over the fence.<br><br>The boys crossed the road before they sat down to get their breath. After a little while the bull lost interest in the boys and wandered off.<br><br>“Boy, I’m glad that’s over,” said Jack, “that beast could have killed me.”<br><br>“Yeah, I guess we were lucky that you weren’t hurt,” said Tom.<br><br>“No more stealing apples for me,” said Jack.<br><br>“Same here,” said Tom. “ I’m going to stick to fishing.	1	2017-04-22 17:51:48.261768	2017-04-23 00:12:21.850016	2010	1	\N	\N	\N	590	\N	\N
112	Snowbound	“What are we doing on an airplane leaving Tampa, north for Washington just when the weather is getting good again in Florida?” I asked my son, David.”<br><br>“Because we have tickets for today,” he said.<br><br>”But it’s a national holiday. Have we no respect for the groundhog? It’s his day. No matter, he no doubt went back into his den hours ago. He couldn’t have missed seeing his shadow.”<br><br>“Yeah, six more weeks of winter, he says.”<br><br>When we reached Dulles Airport a light snow was falling, undisturbed by any breeze. Katyna, who had met us at the airport, had a light but satisfying meal prepared for a couple of hungry travelers.<br><br>Morning broke to a scene washed of color by the night’s delicate brushing of pure white. Every twig, every branch on tree or shrub showed its natural dark gray, but topped with a layer of white frosting. It was a fantasyland of white with only black outlines penciled in. The rare beauty of the scene made one hesitant to shovel the snow from the sidewalks. And so the day passed as an otherwise ordinary day. The snow squall was over and people went on with their business.<br><br>David began checking sources where he might find information about musical events in his area of northern Virginia or Washington. He found events for most every night for the whole week ahead. Looked as if we would not lack for things to look forward to. We went to the first on his list, a flute and harp duo, an unusual combination. The young women presented a varied program, which we enjoyed from our front row seats.<br><br>We were fortunate to have chosen the first opportunity to go to a concert, because the radio was warning of a snowstorm to deliver nine to sixteen inches of the white stuff. It started about noon the next day and it looked like a repeat of the snow with which we had been greeted at the airport, and with no sign of stopping. Several times during the evening David and his neighbors could be heard shoveling snow from their sidewalks. By morning it lay about two feet deep. Road crews working through the night were still busy trying to keep the main roads open. Snowfall continued most of the day, adding another few inches before finally petering out. People whom David had invited found the roads too hazardous and postponed their visits. The next day, Superbowl Sunday, David fetched an old high school friend who lives nearby and we watched the Saints win their game over the Colts. During the next couple of days, when the roads were a bit more passable, son Stephen and grandsons Shawn and Andre came by to see us.&nbsp;<br><br>Just when I thought we had enough snow to last the rest of the winter, and it looked as if the airports would reopen in time for my flight home, the radio warned of a second blast that would bring us another nine inches. And so it did, on the day before I was to leave for home. Needless to say, my flight was cancelled and I was stranded for three more days. I was glad to have such a good host as David to look after me.<br><br>I spent most of the snowbound time reading recorded books or listening to music or the radio, and writing a class assignment. Meanwhile local TV stations did their weird thing of sending some poor junior reporter out in the foul weather to show that we have foul weather such as precipitation and wind. I frequently took note of the scene developing just outside the front window in a little patio where sat a round table and chairs, backed by a small tree. As the snow fell I watched the layer cake on the table, always fully iced, grow from a single layer to perhaps seven layers, almost as high as its width. It seemed to only need a few candles to complete the picture.<br><br>How in the world did I get myself into the all time record snowstorm of the area? Maybe I’m too agreeable. David went to Florida to help out his sister, Susanna, while her husband, Dick, traveled in Europe. David has ideas that nobody else would think of. Why not have a sibling reunion? And it came to pass that it happened for a weekend. I was drawn into the stream. Catherine could spend a week and then go to Tucson for a week on a bead-buying spree. I could go home with David. I was reluctant but chose to go along with the plan rather than stay home alone. The trip was complicated when I caught a nasty cold a few days before we left. I reckon I was pretty bad company for a while.<br><br>Well, things didn’t go exactly as planned, but I saw the deepest snow I had ever seen before other than a drift. Even so, it turned out all right, and we gained more respect than ever for the lowly groundhog.	1	2017-04-22 17:52:06.420325	2017-04-23 00:12:21.856867	2010	1	\N	\N	\N	875	\N	\N
113	Railroad	As I was growing up nearly every boy I knew wanted to have a toy train. It was his dream to find a train under the tree on Christmas morning. I was no different. I looked at the Sears Roebuck catalog and drooled over the pictures of trains in the toy section.<br><br>We lived in sight of a real railroad where many trains passed every day. I wished that I could be the engineer and drive a train. If I had my own train I could make it go whenever I wanted it to go.<br><br>I got my wish one Christmas with a wind-up model. Our country home didn’t have electricity, so wind-up was the only way to go. It just went around in a circle until it needed to be wound again.<br><br>A few years later when we moved to town and had electricity, Santa brought me an electric model that looked just about like the wind-up train. A problem arose when I tried to run it. Santa didn’t provide a transformer. When I tried to run the train from the 120-volt house circuit the motor just smoked and burned. That ended my toy train experience for a while.<br><br>The idea of toy trains lay dormant in my mind for a long time; until I was in my forties. Soon after my own family moved into our Kenilworth Avenue house, I was browsing the magazine display while Mary finished her shopping when I noticed “Model Railroading” magazine and bought a copy. I was amazed at the things I saw in print. Aside from the expected advertising there was an abundance of articles about model trains and layouts. The detailed plans for building rolling stock impressed me most.&nbsp;<br><br>I thought I’d like to try my hand at building a freight car. But I didn’t want to build one just to sit on a shelf and so I expanded my horizons. I visualized the finished room in the basement with a model railroad layout at one end. It would fit there very nicely<br><br>I found myself a few days later in a lumberyard buying some small planking and stuff for making roadbeds to lay track on. With the help of my magazine and subsequent issues I built the framework for my railroad layout. I found a source for HO gauge prefabricated sections of track and kits for cars and locomotives. I bought a few sections of track, a switchyard engine and a power supply. I was in business.<br><br>Little by little I expanded my track, adding switches, spurs etc. I assembled boxcar kits and soon had a working train. I had good intentions of making scenery, including buildings, roads and forests, but never got around to it. Instead, I pursued my first notion of making model cars from scratch.<br><br>I wasn’t satisfied with the starting and stopping motions of my trains. They started with a jerk and stopped similarly. The power supply was a simple transformer-rectifier with a means to vary the output voltage to control the train speed. The jerking problem was a result of overcoming friction of the engine when it was not moving. As suggested by experienced modelers, I built a power supply that provided voltage in short pulses. The engine can be moved very slowly, and the speed will increase when the pulses occur more often. The pulsed power made the train move a lot more realistically.&nbsp;<br><br>Over time I added two steam locomotives, assembled more rolling stock kits and made a few cars from scratch. I much preferred steam engines to the plain looking diesel that has but little personality. My model-railroading hobby lasted until I moved in 1976. It was with some regret that I disassembled the layout and packed it all up for the move.<br><br>The next house didn’t have an inviting place to set up my layout so it remained in its boxes. When I found that I could make a decent tasting wine, I discovered a new hobby that had an entirely different set of amenities.	1	2017-04-22 17:52:26.333207	2017-04-23 00:12:21.863726	2010	1	\N	\N	\N	702	\N	\N
114	Nicknames - Addendum to "Bulldog"	In light of the current assignment it seems appropriate to include “Bulldog” as part of it, even though it is the first story I wrote for this class.&nbsp;<br><br>During my growing-up years I was called by many nicknames, but they never stuck for long, for less than a day and were long ago forgotten. I remember a classmate in my first year in college. His name was Jack Jennings. From our first meeting he called me by a famous name. I don’t know why. Perhaps he needed a crutch to help him remember my name. The famous name he chose was Donald Duck, the famous Disney cartoon character. At any rate Jack continued the name for weeks, then he dropped the first part that pertained to my real name and I became to him simply Duck. I don’t recall others using the name so when I heard “Duck!” yelled behind me I didn’t bend my head down; I waited for Jack to catch up. Jack didn’t come back the next year and the nickname faded into oblivion.<br><br>My most likely nickname couldn’t be in question. Most all the guys I worked with were known by their last names and if the name had more than one syllable it likely got shortened. How does Jess sound? A friend had his own nickname for me. He called me R&amp;D, his variation on my initials, but normally short for research and development, the kind of work I normally did.<br><br>The oddest nickname I had ever heard up to the time I learned that her real name was Idyle Faire Wells was Tump, my mother’s sister. Everybody called Tump “Tump”. I may have heard of someone who called her Idyle but I can’t recall who. She tried to direct me to call her Aunt Idyle but it didn’t work. All I ever heard people call her was Tump.<br><br>How did a good-natured sweet school teacher aunt get a non-word nickname like Tump? I can only report what my grandma told me. Back when Idyle was a little tot, even sweeter than as a teacher and just learning to talk, Grandma was bestowing sweet nothings on her baby. Among the nothings was “You’re Mama’s little sugar lump.” She must have said it more than once so when baby tried to repeat sugar lump it came out tump. Word soon spread through the family and elsewhere what the cute little girl was soon calling herself, and before anyone realized it the baby became Tump. And so it would remain for the rest of her days. The nickname brought her no unpleasant memories, unlike those that “Bulldog” had brought to me.	1	2017-04-22 17:53:05.482573	2017-04-23 00:12:21.870538	2010	1	\N	\N	\N	465	\N	\N
115	Mardelle Quits Me	Following a six-month assignment at the Marine Division in Annapolis, Maryland I returned home. The day after my return Mardelle and I were still sitting at the table in conversation when I heard her say something about a lawyer.<br><br>“Beg pardon?” I queried.<br><br>“I said that I had engaged a lawyer to handle the divorce.”<br><br>“What divorce is that?”<br><br>“Ours,” she said, “I don’t want to be married any more.”<br><br>This bit of information came to me as a bolt out of the blue. I knew that she at times had moments of dissatisfaction; but don’t we all? True, I had been absent for most of the past six months except for alternate weekends when I came home for a couple of days. Possibly she found life more to her liking without me to consider. She was not without concern for me, because on one snowy Friday night when I showed up she gave me a very hard time about the hazards of traveling in such foul weather.<br><br>Mardelle and I met while I was a student at The University of Kentucky where she was employed. I was almost immediately smitten by the lively young woman. The attraction was mutual and we became close friends. Had it not been for the strong possibility of my being drafted into the Army I’d bet that we would have soon been married, but it was not to be. To this day I believe it was Mardelle’s stepmother who put an end to any idea of our union. She had other plans that didn’t include a small town mountain hick.<br><br>More than a quarter century passed during which there were many changes. World War II had brought about changes enough, but changes in our personal lives were profound. She had married a man acceptable to her stepmother, raised three children, divorced the philanderer and developed rheumatoid arthritis. I too had married a woman to whose mother I was most acceptable, raised four children, and I had been recently widowed. In contrast to Mardelle’s, my marriage had been a mostly happy and fulfilling experience with Mary.<br><br>Living alone after Mary’s death, I became very lonely and spent much time wondering how I should spend the rest of my life. I didn’t relish living alone. Having had a good marriage, I naturally thought of finding a mate. None of the several single women in my acquaintance appealed to me; the appealing ones were married. It seemed nonsensical but I began thinking of female friends I had once known. Mardelle topped the list. I had no idea where she lived nor what her circumstances might be. Nevertheless I located her address in Lexington, Kentucky where I had known her. I wrote to her and got back a cool answer. My second letter drew a more favorable response and she agreed to see me as I passed through town. We spent a pleasant afternoon getting reacquainted. She invited me to stop by on my way back home. Although she warned me of her rheumatoid arthritis disability, before I knew it I was a frequent traveler to Lexington to see her. At Christmas time her daughter Glenna became a bride and moved out leaving Mardelle alone in her house.<br><br>Half a year later Mardelle had sold her house and furnishings, and she and her Burmese cat Nedra came to Lima. We were married and moved into my house. The Lima folks made her feel welcome in her new situation. I tried to make her feel at home and we got on pretty well. During our eleven years together I joined in her interests, the main one being the Humane Society and related stuff. We took a vacation every year away from home, sometimes visiting family members, or friends, and sometimes just the pair of us. We even went camping. She found a rheumatologist who served her well in the nearby town of Findlay.<br><br>Of course we had our disagreements as all couples do. Once in a great while she got angry with me and gave me a verbal lashing, and I knew not why. I attributed it to a flare-up of her disease. She always cooled down after a while. Overall, I thought we got along all right. Why did she want to leave me? I never got an answer to the question. I had no animosity toward her, so I gave her all she asked for and bid her goodbye with regret.<br><br>Mardelle went to live with her married son in another town for about a year. We corresponded by letter. In one of her letters she hinted that we could maybe get back together. By then I was reconciled to living alone and thinking of other plans, so I didn’t take the bait.<br><br>Evidently Mardelle found that life with her son was not entirely satisfactory, for she came back to Lima where she lived in a mobile home for several years.<br><br>If there be any moral to this story it might be an old adage I once heard and ignored. “You can’t go back.”	1	2017-04-22 17:53:27.838135	2017-04-23 00:12:21.889345	2010	1	\N	\N	\N	883	\N	\N
124	Write a Poem	<blockquote>We got us a dog at the pound.<br>He didn’t look much like a hound.<br>He likes to chase squirrels<br>Just as boys chase the girls,<br>And he loves to dig holes in the ground.<br><br>The dog from the pound we call Zeke.<br>You might think of him as a freak.<br>He’ll greet you with kisses<br>And in case he misses,<br>He’ll try again till he’s weak.</blockquote><br>All right, enough.&nbsp; Those lines are not poetry, even though they contain rhymes.&nbsp; They are just Limericks.<br>I thought about how to go about writing poetry all day and part of the night.&nbsp; Even though I knew what I wanted to write about I couldn’t get the first line.&nbsp; I decided to write some examples of the closest I would ever come to writing poetry.<br><br><strong>I wrote this of a Pine Mountain amphitheater:</strong><br><br>Eons ago a little stream, storms, wind and snow began eroding a swath down the mountainside, until the amphitheater was formed.&nbsp; It has left on one side of the stream a sheer rock more than a hundred feet high as a backdrop for the theater, and gently sloping ground reaching the forest on the other.&nbsp; <br><br>The CCC boys had busied themselves modifying the nature of the land to create a showplace.&nbsp; Their work provided a stage at the base of the cliff.&nbsp; The stream was dammed to form a narrow reflecting pool in front of the stage.&nbsp; A footbridge spanned the pool at center stage.&nbsp; Mountain laurel outlining the front of the stage was kept low so as to not block the view.&nbsp; Larger plants grew behind the stage.&nbsp; Wherever the layers of rock in the cliff joined, the edges rounded through millennia of erosion, moss and wild flowers grew and laurel clung to the scant soil between.&nbsp; Lichens darkened the face of the rock.&nbsp; At the top of the cliff the usual forest vegetation could be seen.&nbsp; It was a vivid tableau, indeed.&nbsp; <br><br><strong>Of sunrise over Grand Canyon I wrote:</strong><br><br>As the darkness gradually dissipated, parts of the great abyss below began to appear in a faint, warm, rosy glow, becoming ever more intense.&nbsp; The source of this glow appeared as an arc of fire, expanding to a full circle over the horizon.&nbsp; Distant canyon walls began to appear, starting at the canyon rim and creeping downward as the circle of fire ascended into the sky.&nbsp; The shadow hiding the canyon walls gradually fragmented to expose an infinity of shapes and hues.&nbsp; The great pyramids of layered rock inside the canyon cast long shadows through the great gorge.&nbsp; On our side of the canyon there were huge boulders, partly covered by many forms of vegetation that seemed to emit their own glow of multihued light, changing from minute to minute.<br><br><strong>Acadia National Park inspired these words:</strong><br><br>Mount Desert Island is a unique place.&nbsp; Rising several hundred feet above the ocean is a solid granite knoll surrounded by rocky earth, which in turn is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean on one side and a deep fjord on another.&nbsp; The whole area was shaped by the weight of the ancient glacier, which left much of the coastal land submerged.<br><br>At one point the shoreline is broken by a crevice in the rock, perhaps ten yards long.&nbsp; It seemed to be an extra long sunken bathtub, open at one end to the sea.&nbsp; Each incoming wave built up a wall of water that rushed in, filling the tub in seconds with a furious boom when a wall of water hit the tub’s end.&nbsp; The tub emptied awaiting the next wave.&nbsp; It is no mystery that this is called Thunder Hole.<br><br><strong>Of sunrise over the Atlantic Ocean I wrote:<br></strong><br>From our balcony we could watch the sun creep up out of the morning clouds that hovered over the horizon as if trying to prolong the night.&nbsp; But the sun found a crack in the clouds, and sent through them brilliant beams, declaring victory over darkness.&nbsp;	1	2017-04-22 18:16:46.812854	2017-04-23 19:39:02.090852	2011	7	\N		Non-Fiction	739	Late	Poem
117	Glimpse of Virginia	From Cumberland Gap, where three states join, to the Atlantic Ocean there is The Commonwealth of Virginia. Looking for a place of varied interests to explore? Don’t overlook Virginia. From its mountains in the west to bays and beaches in the east many sights and attractions await the traveler.<br><br>Traveling from the Gap up rural Powell Valley you follow alongside scenic Cumberland Mountain where the scene changes with the seasons from winter gray, to many shades of spring green, to the rich green of summer, to a wild array of autumn colors. The road leads to the land where the dreaded air polluter, coal, is mined.<br><br>A turn to the east continues through a mountainous region where a century ago families scratched out a living on the slopes of the hillsides; and some still do. Farther eastward you encounter the Shenandoah Valley, breadbasket of the Confederacy, and the Blue Ridge Mountains. With its many and varied tourist attractions, this might be your favorite part of the Commonwealth.<br><br>The Skyline Drive, a part of the National Park system, follows the crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains and connects with the Blue Ridge Parkway into North Carolina. A drive along these roads offers not only spectacular views of the surrounding countryside but many roadside scenes of flora and fauna. Hiking trails along the drive lead to waterfalls, seen only after a walk down these trails. The walk back to the road is usually the hardest part.<br><br>Towns along its length dot the broad valley, with many picturesque functioning farms in between. It looks like prime farmland. One of the towns is Charlottesville, home of the University of Virginia, originally designed by Thomas Jefferson. Many of the original structures are still in use and interesting to see.<br><br>There are lots of caves and grottos in the mountainside some of which offer tours along lighted paths inside their blackness. When the lights are turned on beautiful scenes of subtle color appear. One cave is famous not for its natural beauty but because it has been transformed into a tourist attraction. Luray Caverns has many formations that, when tapped, vibrate with particular tones. Someone found musical scales among them and devised electric hammers to activate tonal vibrations. He connected them to a keyboard, and lo and behold, a musical instrument was created. During tours a musician plays a short concert on the stalactite “organ”. Rock music?<br><br>Of course Virginia is noted for its colonial and national history. Jamestown and Williamsburg are two examples of early settlements. Both have been restored to resemble their historic forms. They are on display, complete with actors depicting colonial life. Williamsburg the colonial capital is nearly complete with Governor’s Mansion, military provisions, residences, taverns and business establishments to fit the needs of the community.<br><br>Thomas Jefferson built Monticello as his home. A tour of the house and grounds is truly amazing. The house is full of novel conveniences of his invention. The James Madison home is nearby and evidence of many other of the Founding Fathers. George Washington, remember him? Some wanted to make him King. His Mount Vernon home can be found a few miles downriver from the city that bears his name.<br><br>These are just examples of the interesting things found across the land from the mountains to Virginia Beach on the Atlantic Ocean. Many more can be found by the venturous traveler without really trying very hard.	1	2017-04-22 17:54:12.783319	2017-04-23 00:12:21.896155	2010	1	\N	\N	\N	588	\N	\N
118	False Alarm	About mid-afternoon we arrived home after visiting Mardelle’s daughter and parents in Lexington, Kentucky. It had been a pleasant time and we would have enjoyed staying longer, perhaps revisiting some of the old haunts we had enjoyed in former years.<br><br>“It’s good to be home again,” I said, “traveling is always a bit tiring.” Mardelle agreed and went about unpacking our travel stuff. Soon we were back in our regular routine.<br><br>We had been back two or three hours when Mardelle complained about an upset stomach. “Did you eat something that didn’t agree with you,” I asked.<br><br>“No, I ate the same things as you did. Maybe I got some bad water. I had a drink at the rest stop,” she said and went to take something to help settle her stomach. After a while she began to feel worse, complaining of cramps in the gut.<br><br>“Get ready. I’m taking you to the hospital.” Very soon we arrived at the emergency room. She explained the symptoms and was admitted as a patient.<br><br>I hung around waiting to see what was about to happen next. Without any direction I finally noticed a little room that seemed to be empty. I went in, finding it to be of barest essentials. At least there was a chair or two so I sat down to wait. There was not much else to do.<br><br>Meanwhile somewhere upstairs in the maternity ward there were some young men in a waiting room where there were comfortable seats, magazines and ashtrays. At least one man was puffing a cigarette. He put it out and lit another. He sat a while, then got up and paced the floor. I know this scene because I had been there myself, several times.<br><br>In my little room I fidgeted a little and took my pipe and tobacco from my pocket. I half-filled my pipe, tamped the tobacco in and struck a match to light the pipe. The only time a pipe smoker produces an appreciable amount of visible smoke is when he lights his pipe. Otherwise the smoke seen is slight. I began to light the pipe and, as expected, that formed a cloud of dense smoke that rose toward the ceiling. I started to relax with my pipe when a loud and terrible scream sounded. In a moment I decided the scream was in the room with me. It had to be--yes, a smoke alarm. I covered the bowl of the pipe that was not yet hot, with the palm of my hand, stuck my hand with the pipe in my pocket and exited the room. Back in the lobby, I put on my best “what the heck is that noise” look, found a chair and continued my wait.<br><br>There was some bustle around the lobby. A hospital employee scurried in to inspect the little room and turned off the alarm. Presently I thought I heard someone speak the words “fire department”. The smoke alarm had sent a false alarm to the fire department. I never had any idea that lighting my pipe would call firemen to the scene. Nobody asked me and I didn’t volunteer any information. I did however feel a pang of guilt, but that soon passed. How was I to know that the hospital had built in false alarms?<br><br>By and by a nurse escorted Mardelle into the lobby and said that she was ready to go home. The doctor on duty had asked her a lot of questions, examined her vital signs, given her some medicine and opined that she would feel better soon. Good news; she didn’t have to stay.<br><br>“Are you feeling better now?”<br><br>“I’m feeling much better. The medicine the doc gave me seems to help a lot,”<br><br>I took her home and made some chicken soup; or rather, I opened a can. It had been a long time since lunch. She ate a few bites and I finished the rest. Then we sat down in comfortable seats to finish our day by relaxing our frazzled nerves. Our morning trip home had been a real delight, compared to the last few hours. I loaded my pipe for a relaxing smoke, but before I lit up I glanced around to be sure I wasn’t close to the smoke alarm.	1	2017-04-22 17:54:28.384424	2017-04-23 00:12:21.909317	2010	1	\N	\N	\N	747	\N	\N
120	Duplicate Bridge Club	There were several bridge players among my peers at work. Some played during lunch hour and others, with their wives together with other couples played the game. But that wasn’t enough bridge for some and it came to pass that some of the guys got their heads together and formed a group to play duplicate bridge on a regular basis. Thus a duplicate bridge club came into existence. The club had sixteen regular players to form four tables of play.<br><br>As you likely know bridge is a partnership game of two versus two. In duplicate bridge, the hands are played the same as in regular bridge. The difference is that in duplicate bridge all players play the same hands.<br><br>In preparation for the session, a separate deck of cards for each game to be played is dealt into four hands and stored in a special rack having a space for each hand. Ordinarily four racks of cards are stacked and placed on each table.<br><br>In our club, partnerships were predetermined at the beginning of the season. Each member had a different partner for each session, so that by the season’s end each member had been a partner of every other member. Each game was scored according to regular bridge rules. Individual scores were determined by comparison of points scored by each player playing the same hand. After each game the hands were put back in the rack for the next four players. The game scores were tallied for each table after four games were played. Then the players moved to the next table to continue the session and repeated the process until all players had played all the cards.<br><br>At the end of the session the scores of the players playing the north-south hands were compared and given a ranking. The best score received top mark and the other three north-south players received lower marks depending on ranking of their scores. The east-west scores were likewise compared and given marks in the same way. Each player’s rank was tallied and added each session until the end of the season when the season’s winner was determined.<br><br>All the players seemed to like to play with Hayes Crapo as a partner because they had a good chance of making a good score. But this didn’t necessarily give them an advantage. They only got Crapo as a partner once a season. As it turned out the end of the first season found Crapo the winner. There wasn’t a big prize, if any.<br><br>Most of the sixteen players returned for the second season hoping to do better the second time around. After all they’d had a few months to practice. But guess what. Crapo finished again at the top of the class with room to spare. This caused dissatisfaction among some of the players and they sought a change that would level the playing field.<br><br>It was decided to assign each player a partner for the whole season, rather than for only a single session. Following much discussion on the subject they decided to pair the players according to the order of final standing at the end of the last season. The one with the highest score would be the partner of the one with the lowest score, and so on, so that the two guys with the middle scores became partners. Not all the players were happy with the arrangement but they went along with it.<br><br>The third season for the Duplicate Bridge Club met and played as before and most seemed content with things as they were. As the season progressed, a glance at the cumulative scores showed Yohe and Jessee, just a couple of average players who were ranked in the middle, in or near the lead, and Crapo and his partner down the line a piece.<br><br>At the end of the season Yohe and Jessee were declared winners. They took credit for breaking up the club. It was the club’s last season. The players, especially Crapo, seemed to lose interest. Perhaps this goes to show that the game depends on how you stack the deck.	1	2017-04-22 17:55:23.121843	2017-04-23 00:12:21.916223	2010	1	\N	\N	\N	711	\N	\N
121	Crockford	In my early days at Westinghouse, electric power systems used 28-volt direct current generators to provide the electric power required for airplanes. Control and protection devices were required to complete the power system. Our military business was involved with people at Wright Patterson Air force Base where our sales representative was Jack Crockford.<br><br>Tall with sandy colored curly hair, Jack was a young man in his twenties as were many of our coworkers. He made a trip to Wright Field almost weekly to keep up with developments there.<br><br>In the days before President Eisenhower convinced the powers-that-were that the interstate highway system was necessary for national defense, I sometimes was elected to go with Jack as an engineering representative. A lot of our work was to assist the Air Force people in writing specifications for future jobs, which of course we hoped to win.<br><br>Jack had a good appetite after our visits. He took various back roads home and knew of lots of places to get his favorite foods. I think his favorite was corn fritters. We stopped at the Corn Fritter Inn where they served corn fritters, no matter what dinner one ordered. Corn fritters were a doughnut-like concoction without a hole but heavy-laden with whole kernels of sweet corn embedded throughout, and served with maple syrup. Jack wasn’t satisfied with only the Corn Fritter Inn, so he found another place, the West Milton Inn, ten miles out of the way that served the delicacy. On our trip home we scarcely ever missed our fritters.<br><br>Jack did his sales job well and was a good-natured fellow who seemed to like his state-of-being as a bachelor, but he also had a dark side to his personality. He loved practical jokes, at someone else’s expense, of course. After my wedding he corrupted my new brother in law into helping him to pollute the bridal suite with corn fodder, toothbrush bristles in bed, and Limburger cheese on door knobs and on my car’s engine. This after he had been honored as an usher at our wedding.<br><br>Several other guys of our acquaintance were married in the next few years and Jack showed his prints in most of them. Most memorable to me was the La Rotunda wedding. It was a beautiful one that went as planned. I know it was beautiful because my young son whispered “He sure got a pretty woman.”<br><br>During the reception that followed the joker team was busy. Unfortunately for the newlywed couple their getaway car was not properly hidden. Jack’s team was well prepared. It had done its homework ahead of time. When the young couple emerged, ready to leave, they were aghast at the sight of the car. It had the usual Bon Ami white words, “JUST MARRIED” and other fun-poking words scrawled over it. For good measure a square of sheet metal with a couple of punched holes near the top carried its own special message. The metal sign was attached to the car by a chain passed through the prepared holes and around the doorpost through the open windows on the driver’s side. A lock joined the ends of the chain. After a few minutes hesitation the bridegroom entered the car through the door on the passenger side, followed by his bride. He started the engine and began to drive away, but was stopped by a loud ratting noise. It took a moment for him to realize what caused the noise. He had not noticed the tin cans strung to the back bumper. The cans had been carefully tucked under the car, out of sight. As La Rotunda eased the car ahead, likely with bolt cutters in mind, someone handed him the key to the lock. They drove away, cans bouncing along behind until they were out of sight. See, the jokesters were not entirely cruel; the key proves it.<br><br>The sentiment among Jack’s victims grew toward a get-even attitude. They just couldn’t wait for Jack to get married. Boy, we’ll fix him and we’ll have plenty of help. However Jack seemed to be in no hurry to marry; perhaps he really liked being a bachelor with its freedom of movement.&nbsp;<br><br>A few years passed and Jack took a job with a local manufacturers representative. Although he remained in town, his old friends lost close touch with him. One day we learned that a young woman had smitten him. Many of the old friends were invited to the wedding.<br><br>By this time most of those who had been the brunt of Jack’s pranks were family men, interested in their own families. The irony is that it no longer mattered to get even with Jack and he got off Scott-free. I often wondered if he felt slighted. Time really does change things.	1	2017-04-22 17:55:41.874161	2017-04-23 00:12:21.923165	2010	1	\N	\N	\N	826	\N	\N
122	Buttinsky	The clutter on my desk at work was as I had left it on the previous day; nobody had dared clean up my mess. It was my mess and I knew where things I needed were. I continued with my projects where I had left off. I’d written a test letter specifying tests to be run on a power system, so at about mid-morning I went to the test laboratory to check on the progress. Tests were going well with no bad results.<br><br>There was a bulletin board located along the main aisle in the lab where anybody could post notices or most anything of interest. I stopped to see what I might learn from the array of notes. Presently one caught my attention. It was a letter-sized copy of evidently an opinion piece. I began to read it but before I learned the subject of the piece a hand appeared in front of my face, grabbed the paper and removed it as a crumpled wad. I looked around to see what ass had ripped the paper away. Elton Hammond said, “You don’t want to read that.”&nbsp;<br><br>My first impulse was to turn and bury my fist in his gut. At the last moment my better judgment prevailed and I said in my most sarcastic voice, “Thanks pal,” and walked away, thinking that having the manners of a hog at a slop trough was his problem, not mine. Nevertheless this was an incident that I’d not soon forget. It happened more than forty years ago.<br><br>Who did this guy think he was? “You don’t want to read that.” Was I some juvenile under his watch? Rather, I believe he was one of those Liberals who believe in free speech, as long as the speaker agrees with him. I suspect that he had read the posted piece and that it was something he didn’t agree with and he didn’t wanted my mind polluted with such “trash”.&nbsp;<br><br>Elton had never been one of my favorite people but he’d never before been at the bottom of my list. I had seen him butt into people’s conversations to offer his comments, but I’d never seen outright rudeness before.<br><br>I wondered why Elton was so different from most people. I even wondered if his wife had something to do with the difference. I was only casually acquainted with her. She taught English at a college. I had no idea how she thought of herself but she gave me the impression that she considered herself a notch above the average schnook. Maybe he was merely trying to keep up with her expectations. But who knows?<br><br>I let such thoughts run through my mind for a few days and finally realized that there was probably nothing I could do about it. I forgave him in my heart for being so ill mannered that day. Afterward when I met him in the hall I gave him a friendly hello and went about my business. Elton would always be Elton.	1	2017-04-22 17:56:08.324825	2017-04-23 00:12:21.930074	2010	1	\N	\N	\N	524	\N	\N
126	Win, Lose or Draw	The Pineville High School football team had a respectable season up until the last game. They could not win the conference championship, but they could improve their standing in the conference by winning their last game of the season. The season always ended with a game against Middlesboro, a game that would be remembered throughout the coming year. It was as if the whole season could be rescued by winning the game against Middlesboro.<br><br>The big day was at hand when the Yellow Jackets of Middlesboro arrived in town for the game against the Pineville Mountain Lions. The November day was cold and overcast. It had rained in recent days and the surface of the ground was frozen to a depth of an inch or so. To top it off, about an inch of snow covered the frozen ground. The usual method of lining the field with lime would not work over the snow, so slack coal was used instead of lime. Despite the weather there was a good turnout for the game.<br><br>In their respective dressing rooms the coaches were preparing their teams with last minute instructions and the equipment managers were guarding the players against the ice and snow. They had a liquid they rubbed on hands to enhance circulation and it worked beautifully. Only one thumb was reported to be cold.<br><br>“Coach,” a young player asked, “would you rather we would win 7 to 6 or tie 0 to 0?”<br><br>That sounded like a pretty dumb question. Right? Maybe it was and maybe it wasn’t. Several years earlier, Pineville skunked Middlesboro when the game was played in Pineville. People remembered the zero part of the scores. Soon nobody remembered the Yellow Jackets ever scoring a point on the Lions’ field. The last two games played in Pineville ended in scoreless ties. People began to think of it as a jinx. To be sure there were lots of fans in the stands that day who wanted the jinx to hold regardless of the outcome.<br><br>“To win, of course,” Coach Grabuck said in response to the young player’s query, “This team always plays to win so long as I’m in charge. I don’t believe in any jinx and neither should you. All it would take for them to score is just one tiny slip. But win, lose or draw, never let it be said that you didn’t give it your best. Now let’s get out there and win this game.”<br><br>It was tough going on the field for both teams. The icy crust broke underfoot and made normal running impossible. None of the fancy plays were practical and had to be abandoned for just the basic plays. The first half ended with no score. The school bands performed their half-time shows and were glad to be done with them.<br><br>The second half was much like the first until the Yellow Jackets stung the Lions with a touchdown. They missed the extra point, but the “jinx” had been broken. Score 6 to 0: Middlesboro.<br><br>The score remained the same until midway through the forth quarter when Pineville scored a touchdown to tie the game at 6 to 6. That would never do. Pineville didn’t have a good kicker, but they had a heavy fullback. They ran a fake kick play and the fullback drove his mass over the goal line for the point. That proved to be the end of the scoring for this game.<br><br>Final score:<br><br>Middlesboro—moral victory<br><br>Pineville—real victory	1	2017-04-22 18:18:56.176378	2017-04-23 00:12:21.944971	2011	1	\N	\N	\N	612	\N	\N
127	Transition	Sometime I went through a transition from childhood to becoming a man. I never considered that there was a time when such a transition may have happened. I just grew into it without noticing the difference. Childhood had many phases, few of which were near to manhood.<br><br>My high school days ended when I was 18. By that time I had done the things that teen-agers typically do: become an athlete, learn things but only if I thought I needed to know, get by with things my parents didn’t know about, vie for attention, especially among girls. I felt pretty much grown up. I was big enough to be a man, but was lacking something, or a lot of things.&nbsp;<br><br>With a lot of help I set off for college. One thing I noticed was that the restrooms were labeled “men” and “women”. Surely this must be it. This place is for men and women, but I was there only by the grace of my father who paid most of the bills even though I worked to help pay the bills. Living away from home was not enough to make me a man. I would have to be on my own and out of the care of my parents to be known as a man. So I toiled on as a college student for four years and earned a BSEE degree, thinking I could pull my weight as an electrical engineer thereby contributing to the winning of World War II. By the time I graduated in 1943 I was in love with a young woman. I hoped to marry her when the war was over. I was in no way ready to support a wife at that time.&nbsp;<br><br>Upon graduation I was offered jobs with the government at Oak Ridge and with Westinghouse. The recruiters could not tell me what kind of work I’d do at Oak Ridge. I opted for Westinghouse where a variety of jobs was available.<br><br>I was soon off to Pittsburgh where I spent a few months on the Westinghouse student course. There I had the opportunity to get acquainted with several types of work to help me decide my career path. The best part was that I not only got to see engineers in action but I got paid for it. A good thing, too, my one and only suit had served me for too many years. One could see the color of my drawers through the shiny seat of my pants.<br><br>I suppose that had I been asked at the time if I had entered into manhood I’d have chosen this day: I’d saved enough money to buy a brand new suit and went out and bought it. No help from my family.<br><br>I went to Ohio for my final student course assignment. There they designed and manufactured electric power equipment for aircraft. The design work seemed to be to my liking, so I decided to accept a job at that plant. I was just getting settled into the job so as to be productive when the long arm of Uncle Sam reached in for my body. I say body because he didn’t much care what I could do, so long as I could follow orders. And that I did, for my whole military career: “Tenshun,” “Forward harch,” “Lights out,” “Everybody up for a little midnight hike.” And so it went.<br><br>Where did this put me on my transition to manhood? One might say it dumped me into the middle of it. On the other hand maybe I was back to the starting point. I now had new parents to direct my life. I’d had more freedom as a teen-ager at home with my real parents.<br><br>Upon my discharge I felt a sense of freedom as I went back to my job. I could even wear my now-not-so-new suit. I felt free to make plans without the cloud of uncertainty looming just ahead. I saved some money and in a few months I was ready to find a wife and settle down. Although I’m not sure just when it happened the transition was now complete.	1	2017-04-22 18:19:11.807148	2017-04-23 00:12:21.951812	2011	1	\N	\N	\N	716	\N	\N
116	Life with Mary	Memory fades with age as with most all other faculties. Rather than to attempt to write a narrative about my life with Mary, I shall try to relate some of the things I remember pretty well. If I mess up the chronology, so be it.<br><br>Mary’s family went to the Lutheran Church all her life. It was ordained that we should be married in that church. We attended the Lutheran Church for a while, but I was dissatisfied with the ritual.<br><br>“You Lutherans have way too much getting up and down, what say we try the Presbyterian Church just down the street,” I suggested. She agreed and tried it and joined after a few months.<br><br>We made do as newlyweds in our little shack on the edge of town. Winter demanded that I bring home a gallon of fuel oil each night so as to cook and keep warm. It soon became a priority to find a better place to live. Years after World War II apartments for rent were scarce. We were fortunate that a cousin of Mary had a small place for rent. We took the place and lived there until we got out own house five years later.<br><br>Mary worked at Hart Jewelers before we were married and continued her job for a time afterwards. As a wedding present, the jeweler gave Mary a set of silverware, entirely out of place in our shack but enhanced our apartment.<br><br>We lived like newlyweds in our apartment for nearly a year, and then pregnancy interrupted our blissful thoughts. We talked over the situation and agreed that Mary should give up her job to begin preparing for family life. We could live on my salary. I’d received raises and expected more. And so Mary traded her store clerk job for that of a housewife and mother to be. Our five-year apartment life was a productive one. Within two weeks after moving to our new house our family of four children was complete.<br><br>From the birth of our firstborn, my mother-in-law (Bessie to me, Granny to the kids) played a significant role in our family life. The baby was only a few days old when Bessie spoiled him by picking him up from his crib and cuddling him when he cried out. She claimed that he had colic. It was only after three days of Granny’s absence that his colic was cured – by neglect. Afterwards she became a real fan of all the children, and loved to be with them.<br><br>It was many years later that Granny spent Christmas Eve alone because the kids insisted that she spend the night at our house and play with their toys with them on Christmas day.<br><br>Since Granny enjoyed the kids, Mary felt free to have her mother sit with them now and then while we were away. We’d eat supper together and leave them to their own devices. It was at meals that Bessie and I would argue about all kinds of things. We could argue through many meals about the same subject. One of our favorite subjects was competition. She thought it was a bad thing while I tried to convince her that without it there would be no incentive to make things better or affordable. She must have taken her stance from the Bible, Acts chapter 5 where Peter formed a commune of believers; but that was a small group who pooled their wealth to survive in a big hostile world. I don’t remember ever resolving an argument, but we had lots of fun with them.<br><br>To be continued.	1	2017-04-22 17:53:51.863892	2017-04-23 00:12:21.958669	2010	1	\N	\N	\N	621	\N	\N
123	Blind Hog	“Even a blind hog finds an acorn now and then.” Quoted by my boss B.O. Austin and I’m sure many others before him.<br><br>The quotation applied to me on many occasions when B.O. assigned me a job that I knew absolutely nothing about or where to start looking for answer. Nevertheless I usually rooted around until I found an answer somewhere. I’ll try to tell of the biggest and juiciest acorn this hog found. It happened years after B.O. retired.<br><br>Joe Urish was working on a d-c to a-c power converter for military aircraft. The prototype worked fine, but it had one disturbing deficiency. Under certain load conditions the output voltage became distorted so that it didn’t meet the specifications. One day Joe came to talk about the problem, wondering if I had any ideas.&nbsp;<br><br>“You might use a bigger filter,” I suggested, “but that would increase the weight.”<br><br>“Yeah, we’re near the limit already,” said Joe.<br><br>“I don’t know what we can do to fix it, but I’ll think on it,” I said.<br><br>The means for making alternating current from a direct current source is a digital scheme whereby the load receiving power is connected to the source for a time, then switched to reverse the polarity for a time, and so on, thus generating a series of alternate positive and negative pulses to the load. By varying the duration of the pulses, an a-c voltage can be generated having the desired properties. A filter provides a buffer between the raw pulses and the desired output voltage.<br><br>If the switching occurred at the precise times as designed, Joe’s problem would not exist. Unfortunately it takes time for a switch to respond to a command. Response time can vary for several reasons. The main culprit is the magnitude of current in the switch. The cause being identified, what can we do about it?<br><br>I scratched my head; rooting around in my brain and anywhere else I could think of for a possible solution. I couldn’t find an obvious answer. After a few days it occurred to me that if I could adjust the control signal depending on the load, I could whip this thing. Finally I stumbled across the obvious.<br><br>I could measure the time it takes for the switch to respond to a command, and use the data to modify the control signal, which it repeats periodically. In essence, each switching time delay is put into a memory until the cycle is repeated. Then it is used to cause the control signal to operate sooner than normal, thus compensating for the switching delay, and generating an acceptable output voltage, independent of the load.<br><br>Since this control method was found to be useful in other even more important jobs, it was committed to a single integrated chip dubbed the Jessee Circuit. I recon this turned out to be my biggest and best acorn.	1	2017-04-22 17:56:28.905058	2017-04-23 00:12:22.000104	2010	1	\N	\N	Non-Fiction	515	\N	\N
128	All Broken Up	“He’s tall.”<br><br>“Yeah, he is tall.”<br><br>I looked around as best a nearly blind guy who’s still asleep could. I couldn’t see anyone fitting the tall description; just a couple of short women very close to me. Then I noticed that they had their arms about me, and in no comforting way. What was happening to me was the question. After much tugging and grunting by the women I found myself in a narrow bed. My sleep had definitely been disturbed, but what was that all about? Hmm, “tall”? Maybe they were talking about me. Chatter and strange noises continued and I fell back to sleep.<br><br>When I finally awoke I discovered that the narrow bed was a hospital model that was much like a bird’s nest. A body could not get out of it without help. Now I understood the women’s tugging and grunting.<br><br>But why was I here? One of the last things I heard before the “tall” comments was by a male voice that said, ”I can do the surgery this afternoon.”<br><br>“The surgery must have taken place, to me, of course,” I thought. I felt round about for bandages and stuff, but I couldn’t move enough to find anything other than a brace that made it impossible to move my right arm.<br><br>Bye and bye I began to remember what had happened to me and why I was here. I started my day early by getting out of bed to go to the bathroom. Only I didn’t make it there. Evidently, in getting out of bed, I didn’t pause long enough to decide whether I was awake or still asleep. Sleep must have won, for I woke up on the floor beside the bed. Remember the TV spot where an old lady lies on the floor and says, “I’ve fallen and I can’t get up.” Picture that scene, but substitute me, an old man, as the star character. In due time Catherine came by on her way to walk the dog. I yelled to her for help to get up. A brief look at me told her that I was not to get up for a while. A 911 call, a short ride flat on my back and the hospital had another victim.<br><br>I barely recall being in the emergency room, much less what happened there. I suppose there was no question that there were some broken bones so it was off to the X-ray machine. The right leg and the right arm were broken, and I’m right handed. It must have been about then that the male voice announced his intention to do surgery that afternoon.<br><br>In a couple of days I heard talk of therapy. Insurance would cover twenty days of in-hospital therapy because of multiple fractures. Not long after that a crew of movers came to take me away. It was only a short trip. We didn’t even leave the building. It turned out to be a step up in the world for me; we left the fourth for the tenth floor, surely a step up. As they unloaded their cargo (my body) and put it into the bed I heard familiar words along with tugging and grunting.<br><br>“He’s tall.”<br><br>“He is tall. Let me get a better hold around him.” And there I was in my home base in a facility that came highly recommended by a former patron. I even met the tin man while I was there.<br><br>The therapists seemed to be good at their jobs. I believe they wanted to make one want to regain his former agility and it takes work by the patient.<br><br>After the mandatory pills and checking of the vitals my day started with “Mr. Jessee, it’s Amy. I’m here to give you your bath and get you dressed for the day.” Her job was to help me learn to manage putting my clothes on without help. She showed me how to use a grabber stick to put on my pants and socks, since I could not move my broken leg at first.<br><br>I could tell by her sweet voice that she was a twenty-something young chick. She always seemed glad to see me. Sometimes Amy came before breakfast and sometimes breakfast came before Amy, but Amy was much preferred over breakfast. Ever tried to eat a hospital meal, especially wrong handed? I met Amy again later in the day for therapy on my shoulder.<br><br>Holly or Rachel came for me after I was dressed for the day. We went to the “gym” for workouts. I got to lie down and lift my broken leg 15 times when I could barely lift it at all. But in doing these exercises every day I finally was able to do them easily. My doctor allowed me to walk twenty feet at a time so we practiced walking as well.<br><br>Hospitals are pretty boring places to hang out in. The food is bad, you can’t get enough sleep “wake up and take your sleeping pill” and there’s always somebody ready to disturb your thoughts. Worst of all whatever ills, aches and pains one had before the visit will be worse when one gets out.<br><br>When my time was up I was ready to go home if I could take Amy with me. But nothing doing so I shed a tear as we left.&nbsp;	1	2017-04-22 18:19:31.130453	2017-05-01 22:16:00.330737	2011	8	hosptial.jpg	\N	\N	945	\N	\N
119	An Easter Egg Hunt	Momma was getting me ready for a special day at school. My second grade class was to have an Easter party before class was dismissed for the day but class would be over at the regular time. Momma combed my hair, as if it would stay combed for more than a few minutes. She saw to it that I wore my best shorts; I’d much rather have worn long pants like the big boys. She made me put on shoes and socks; it was too early in the season for going barefooted she said. She sent me off down the road, lunch in hand telling me to be a nice boy.<br><br>It seemed to me that the teacher would have been better served to have not mentioned that we were to have a little party later in the day. The children seemed restless as if waiting for something momentous to happen. Time dragged on until soon after lunchtime.<br><br>“All right class, line up and follow me.” The teacher said as the class followed out of the school building in a line of two and three abreast. A walk of two or three hundred yards led to a park-like clearing at the edge of a woods. It was a grassy area the size of a large back yard. The grass was springtime green with many tufts of longer grass and small shrubs scattered throughout. A small clear and shallow stream flowed alongside the area.<br><br>“’Boys and girls, I heard that someone has hidden a big basket of colored eggs somewhere in this grassy place. I’ll pass out some bags for you, then you may start your Easter egg hunt. There are none in the woods. Have fun!” And we were off and hunting.<br><br>“I found one” “A green one,” “Here’s a blue one,” ”Yellow,” went up cheers of glee. Even I found two or three for my bag. It seemed the girls were finding most of the eggs. I looked under a little shrub at the edge of the grass, but I didn’t see an egg; instead I saw a snake that seemed much bigger than it was, sunning itself in the warm spring sunshine. I stepped back, the little black snake slithered off into the woods, and I wet my pants. With that, my hunt was over. Hoping that nobody noticed the color difference in my pants leg, I made my way to the little brook, took off my shoes and socks, left them with my eggs and waded in the shallow water. The water flowed over a flat bed of rounded gravel, only about two inches deep and produced a pattern of ripples on the surface. The cool water felt good on my feet and made an interesting pattern as it slid across the gravel. What I didn’t notice was that the sight was also mesmerizing, and the next thing I knew I was sitting on that handsome bed of gravel with the water all around. I didn’t really mean to sit down in the brook, but at least no one would notice a wet streak down my leg.<br><br>“Ralph Donald, get out of the water and put your shoes on; it’s time to go back to the school,” said the teacher who didn’t have any kind words for me. All the way back I was thinking about a former outing where I didn’t get wet.<br><br>On the side of a ridge near home there was an outcropping of sandstone that formed a bed of sand left under it by erosion of the outcropping. The sand was always dry in its sheltered place, and an ideal place for doodlebugs. Mainly undisturbed by wind and rain the doodlebug lived in his quiet, peaceful corner of the world. I was not content to let him go on so quietly. I crawled in near his abode and called to him and his neighbors, “Doodlebug, doodlebug, stick out your head and I’ll give you a piece bread.” He wouldn’t stick out his head.<br><br>Here’s a word of explanation for anyone not familiar with the doodlebug. He is a small bug, maybe an insect, as much as half an inch long. He has strong kicking legs. He borrows in the dry sand and kicks grains of sand away from himself until he has formed a cone-shaped pit about an inch deep around himself. He then resides at the bottom waiting for his dinner to arrive. He is known as an ant lion. Should an ant have the misfortune to wander to the edge of the pit he becomes a meal for the doodlebug. The ant cannot gain traction in the sloping sand and can move only toward his doom at the bottom of the pit.<br><br>How could I tell that a doodlebug was at home? Evidently the sound of my voice signaled movement in the sand and alerted him to position himself for a potential dinner. If the voice call didn’t work I could usually draw him out of the sand with a small straw that he would grab onto while I pulled him out of the sand to get a look at him. I always wondered how the doodlebug ever got out of his hole. Maybe he never had the desire to escape. After my doodlebug outing I may have been a bit dirty, as young boys often get but I was dry.<br><br>The walk back to the schoolhouse didn’t dry my pants but it was nearly time to go home and I didn’t have long to suffer. On the way home, despite being still wet, I didn’t have to tell Momma about my adventure with the little snake: well, not all of it.	1	2017-04-22 17:54:46.048498	2017-05-01 22:25:43.508777	2010	1	easterEggs.jpg	\N	Non-Fiction	985	Early	Story
130	Springtime	1931: I’m just getting home from school. Home is at Grandma Wells’ house until school’s out. That’ll be a couple of months yet. I no sooner get home than I’m informed of the most exciting event of the season.<br><br>“Ol’ Pied had her calf last night. You can run down to the barn and have a look at the calf. It’s a heifer. That’s good; we can use another milk cow. Couldn’t tell you this morning cause it’d made you late for school,” Grandma informs me.<br><br>I’m trotting down the lane past the paw-paw patch to the barn. I stub my toe on a rock. That hurts. Good thing I’m not barefooted. I peek in through a crack in the barn door. Sure enough, I see a calf resting beside her mama. Fine looking baby Pied has. I go in for a better look. Stinks in here. I go out for a fresh breath. It’s not as fresh as I expected. Smells like coal smoke. A train must have gone by while I was looking at the calf. Thought I’d heard it but hadn’t paid much attention.<br><br>Another day at school and I’m heading home. It warmed since morning. Don’t need the coat so I take it off sling it over my shoulder and start my walk home. I’m on the steep part of the road. Makes my legs tired and my whole body hot. Seems farther to the top on a warm day. I finally reach the top and begin to breathe easier. I hear crows cawing and look up. Three crows fly across the hollow. I wonder if the ridge they’re going to is better than the one they left. I’m really warmed up by this time.<br><br>“Grandma,” I say, “is it all right if I quit wearing my long handles? It’s too hot.”<br><br>“I suppose so, but it may turn cold again this time of year,” she says.<br><br>“If it turns cold again I’ll just walk faster.” I press my luck, “Can I go barefooted too?”<br><br>“Oh yes, in another month,” she says, “but I have something you’ll like while you’re waiting. Kyle was up in the apple orchard this morning. He brought back a mess of morel mushrooms.”<br><br>I look at a bowl full of mushrooms. They look like a bowl of sponges. Grandma cooks them and serves them as part of supper. Boy, they sure taste good. I hope there are more where those came from.<br><br>It’s Saturday. No school today. I’m finally barefooted, thank goodness. Everything’s green and blooming. Grandma has some flowers in her yard. Nothing smells better than the lilacs. I see some wild flowers close to the house. I recognize the columbine. Grandma calls them tangle britches, a good name for them. School will be out soon and my folks will be coming to take me to Kentucky before long. I may as well enjoy the rest of my stay here.<br><br>1934: I try on my new shoes. They’re a mite too big; to allow for growing I think. Got them just in time for Easter. Ladies in new hats won’t be the only ones to sport new clothes.<br><br>It’s Easter morning. We’re not supposed to have snow today but there it is, two or three inches of it. Sure can’t depend on spring weather. Mama says I’d better not wear my new shoes today. Well the snow can’t last long; it’s spring.<br><br>The snow’s all gone and it’s a beautiful sunny day. From here I can see the mountain across the river. Some of the trees are beginning to show new leaves. The tulip trees are the brightest, light spring green. Smiling yellow daffodils are in bloom, outdoing the dandelions. A robin hops along looking for an earthworm. He flies up into a tree and delights me with his song.<br><br>My Boy Scout troop goes on a camping weekend today. Maybe I can finish my second-class badge requirements.<br><br>We’re at the scout camp. We will sleep in the lodge. Amster our scoutmaster has a fire going. Looks like he’s going to heat a pot of beans. The beans are hot and he has weenies to roast. We gather sticks, roast weenies and have hot dogs and beans for supper. I can imagine the sounds tonight in the lodge.&nbsp;<br><br>It is nearly dark except for a silvery moon. All the boys gather around a campfire. It’s a pretty sight with flames reaching up to kiss the sky. The crackling sound and the whiffs of wood smoke make a pleasant relief from winter nights. We sing a few songs, and when the fire dies down to embers we head for the lodge. Nobody is ready for sleep. Hear lots of chatter for a while. A mosquito buzzes around my ear. Time passes and the boys finally quiet down. I hear an owl hoot in the woods. Tomorrow will be a fine day I think, before I doze off.<br><br>At home Daddy is busy planting his garden. Some boys are playing ball. Girls are playing hopscotch. Moms are getting ready to fix supper. Spring is a fickle time, bringing hope and disappointment, but always new life.	1	2017-04-22 18:20:15.966243	2017-04-23 00:12:22.007038	2011	1	\N	\N	\N	934	\N	\N
131	Shortenin’ Bread	“Mammy’s little baby loves shortenin’ bread.” That’s my favorite song for singing. I used to sing it to my kids as we drove down the highway, that is until they got tired of the song and started singing something else. Actually they tolerated it for a relatively long time and joined in. It’s a nice bouncy little tune that won’t put one to sleep, fun and easy to sing. Besides that, it promotes the advantageous qualities of shortenin’ bread. For example, consider the line “Three little darkies layin’ in da bed, two wus sick and da other most dead. Sent fur da doctor, da doctor said, ‘feed dem chillen on shortenin’ bread.’” According to the song shortenin’ bread is good stuff.<br><br>Some unhappy, politically correct people may think the song racist because of its reference to Mammy or little darkies or the dialect or some other absurd thing. There is nothing racist about the song. It’s just a delightful little ditty that’s fun to sing. Surely one can speak in descriptive language without being racist. And politically correct garbage exists only to limit one’s freedom of speech.<br><br>I’m pretty sure that the first lady – what’s her name – oh yeah, Michelle Obama wouldn’t approve of the song on the grounds that shortenin’ bread may be fattening. I wonder if she thinks she’s the official obesity czar. If she could wean Mammy’s little baby off shortenin’ bread and substitute vegetables and fruit, the problem would be solved wouldn’t it? Well, she has her hands in the school lunch (or is it breakfast, lunch and supper) program. Instead of feeding the children food they like, give them fruits and veggies and ban all snacks from the schoolhouse. How did Michelle get to be the national expert on nutrition? Four years ago nobody had ever heard of her. Ever wonder why the President sneaks out to fast food joints?<br><br>Certainly children’s fatness has lots to do with what they eat, but I’ll bet it has more to do with what they do. I hear that schools have little or no recess these days. I contend that a half hour of outdoor play and less time with their electronic toys would do much more for slimming down the children than will fruits and veggies.<br><br>Let’s close this little rant on a happy note. OK? “I slipped to da kitchen, slipped off da led, filled my pockets wid shortenin’ bread. Stole da skillet, stole da led, stole da gal dat made da shortenin’ bread. They caught me wid da skillet, caught me wid da led, caught me wid da gal dat made da shortenin’ bread. (sadly) Paid six dollars fur da skillet, six dollars fur da led, spent six month in jail (joyfully) eatin’ shortenin’ bread.”	1	2017-04-22 18:20:39.810458	2017-04-23 00:12:22.014419	2011	1	\N	\N	\N	484	\N	\N
132	Riddle	Fred walked in, just arriving home from work. He greeted Fran with a friendly kiss on her lips, and said “Hi, Babe. Did you have a good day?”&nbsp;<br><br>“Good enough I guess,” she replied, “I did a little dusting. The stuff just won’t stay outside.”<br><br>Fred looked around and said, “Good job, I don’t see any dust except what I just tracked in. Aunt Martha is looking in a different direction from usual.” Fred went to the mantle where Aunt Martha’s picture sat and turned it slightly to its usual position. Something fell from the back of the picture. “Aunt Martha, you’re too old to be having babies,” he said and picked up the object from behind Aunt Martha. It was a piece of paper, folded neatly and had been tucked into a crevice formed in the framing process. The paper was old, maybe as old as the picture. Aunt Martha looked to be in her late twenties. She had been a pretty young woman. Fred and Fran had had the picture for at least twenty years. They had brought it from the old homestead before it was demolished.<br><br>“What’s the paper? I must have dusted harder than usual,” Fran said.<br><br>“Looks like a note. Come, sit down and let’s read it together.”<br><br>The note was nearly a hundred years old, and the paper very fragile. It read,<br><br>“May 1913: Jack and Bob were first cousins and nearly the same age. They should have been good buddies. But no; something happened to make them bitter enemies.<br><br>“Last time Bob was here, so was Jack. It was when they were finishing the new three-seat privy. Bob had a satchel with him and said he was on his way to California on the night train. Just stopped to say goodbye. I think Jack offered him a ride to the station. Nobody has seen or heard of Bob since. On the other hand Jack seems to be very prosperous. The police have looked around here for clues but found nothing. I have not talked to the police but thought somebody ought to know.<br><br>(Signed) Joe Keller”<br><br>“Wow, who would have thought there were skeletons in my closet? A guy disappears without a trace. You’d think Bob would have let somebody know that he was still alive and kicking.”<br><br>“Maybe so, but did he have something in the satchel he didn’t want anybody to know about?”<br><br>“Yeah? Like what?”<br><br>“Like something of their granddad’s that could be stolen, and used by anybody else and suppose Jack knew about it. Maybe they were both after Granddad’s stash. Come to think of it, there is no evidence given that Jack and Bob were enemies. It could be only the writer’s opinion. Maybe the enemy thing was only an act in their plan.”<br><br>“The note said that maybe Jack offered Bob a ride to the station. We don’t know if Bob accepted the offer.”<br><br>“I wonder what could be the significance of the time this event took place. For instance, the building of a new privy and especially one with thee seats.”<br><br>“There would be a fresh deep hole in the ground, fairly long, for three seats, and there would be a pile of loose dirt handy.”<br><br>“Are you suggesting…”<br><br>“Just a possibility.”<br><br>“I know that privies get pretty stinky fast, but with a rotting body covered with only a little dirt—how could it not be noticed?”<br><br>“As the writer of the note wanted, at last somebody knows. What is there to do about it? Nothing we could do could possibly make any difference now.”<br><br>“Unless-- -- Maybe we could find the location of the former privy and put up a marker that says ‘Bob, maybe’,”	1	2017-04-22 18:21:00.684207	2017-04-23 00:12:22.021407	2011	1	\N	\N	\N	673	\N	\N
133	Phonics with Monica	One day I began to wonder what was in the boxes that I had stashed away out of sight. Some of the boxes had rested where they lay ever since I moved to Lafayette seven years ago. There couldn’t be anything I needed in them. I’d had lots of help packing up the stuff to bring with me. My children packed the things they thought to be of value, either real or sentimental. I dragged out a few items and with help inspected one. Guess what!<br><br>Ninety per cent of it was worth the price of scrap paper: 1990’s tax returns and obsolete reports. One item however caught my eye.<br><br>A crocheted afghan came out of the closet. It was a colorful, attractive piece of work, done in a zig-zag pattern of alternating brown, yellow and green. Though I knew it was there, the odd thing is that I had not used it on the recent chilly nights. Nevertheless it served to remind me of a brief encounter with a young woman.<br><br>Having completed second grade our son could read his “Dick and Jane” book perfectly well – so long as he had the pictures in front of him. Hide the pictures and he couldn’t read any of it. After six weeks of special instruction in summer school he read at the sixth grade level. A few years later, no doubt influenced by this and similar incidents, four women got their heads together to try to improve reading skills among school kids. Mary, Mary, Jane and Sally decided to attack the problem head on. The self-appointed four discovered a book about phonics written by Sister Monica Frazier of Xavier University in Cincinnati. They contacted Monica who agreed to help with their project.<br><br>I arrived home from work one afternoon and was surprised to find that we had a guest. She was none other than Sister Monica. She was a petite woman without outstanding features, pleasant of voice and cordial. She settled in as part of our family for the better part of a week.<br><br>Monica went with the Four to visit teachers, school board members and school administrators for the next several days presenting the idea that phonics was a better way for children to learn reading than the “gaze and guess” method that was evidently popular at the time.<br><br>During her stay with us Monica taught me a bit about phonics. I knew of course that letters of the alphabet represented sounds that a reader must know. Syllables, too, have certain sounds, but not always the same. There are so many exceptions to the rule that English is not really a phonetic language. “But,” said Monica, “close enough is good enough. The vast majority of words can be recognized using phonics and the exceptions can be learned later.”<br><br>I believe the ladies had a productive time and that Monica went home satisfied with her mission. A few weeks later the mailman delivered a package to our door. It turned out to be a thank you gift for Mary the hostess, from Monica. Opening the package Mary found a colorful crocheted afghan and two matching cushions.	1	2017-04-22 18:21:20.066426	2017-04-23 00:12:22.029305	2011	1	\N	\N	\N	543	\N	\N
134	Part Time Home	The Cornn family lived but a block past the schoolyard playground. Frequently kids lingered after school for a game of touch football or some other physical game. I was occasionally one of the participants but more likely I would go on by with my friend Billy, youngest of the Cornn family. Billy and I were classmates and buddies. We found lots of things to talk about but seldom about schoolwork. Now and then I failed to turn left to head for my home and we ended up on Billy’s front porch. I felt no urgency to get home so I hung around for a while.<br><br>We showed up at Billy’s house often enough that Mrs. Cornn invited me to come in out of the cold. That must have been the time when I became a transient part of the Cornn family. My visits were by no means a daily affair. Ordinarily I stayed only a little while and then I went on home.<br><br>There was nothing fancy about Billy’s mom. She was a friendly woman who accepted me as a friend of her son and treated me as one of the family. She was a typical, pretty well off housewife of the depression era, ready to help where she could.<br><br>Billy’s dad owned a garage and worked there. He wasn’t afraid to get his hands dirty. I don’t have much recollection of him because he was usually still at work when I visited.<br><br>Billy had a brother and a sister. His brother worked for his dad at the garage and, as with his dad, I saw little of him. Billy’s sister was away at college most of the time but I saw her more often than I saw the men. She was a well-fed looking young lady with a good disposition and fun to be around.<br><br>Billy was a slightly built, straight-haired fellow, not as tall as I. Few my age were that tall. Even at his young age he was a student of racehorses. I think he studied them since he learned to read. He knew the names of all the good ones as well as many of the nags. I was fascinated that he could keep track of so many horses. I learned that the Louisville Courier Journal had a section devoted to horse racing. It not only reported the race results, but also had stories about horses and their careers. After all his studying it was no surprise that Billy took up betting imaginary money on the races. It became his main hobby. I became his listening audience. Every few days he reported his winnings when we saw each other at school. His two-dollar bet had gained him a hundred, two hundred, or even four hundred dollars. All that changed the day he went with his brother to Churchill Downs and he bet his own cash savings. He managed to parlay his two-dollar bets to zeros. He resumed his amateur status.<br><br>Let’s not forget Mutt the family dog. She was a white terrier with brown ears. She looked to be the best fed member of the family. Think long watermelon with short legs. She rarely caused any trouble; just waddled around.<br><br>As we grew to high school age our interests began to change, and while we were still great friends we didn’t meet at Billy’s house often. I became interested in football and girls. I went out for the team which used my after school time during the season. Girls attracted my attention any time. And it came to pass that I drifted away from my second family.	1	2017-04-22 18:22:25.017885	2017-04-23 00:12:22.036111	2011	1	\N	\N	\N	625	\N	\N
135	Ninth Decade Gone	What ever happened to my ninth decade? It wasn’t everybody’s ninth decade, just mine. It started on a tragic note. Two days before its start three thousand people lost their lives in the collapse of the twin-towers brought on by terrorists. The war on terror did not end during my ninth decade.<br><br>A number of life-changing events took place during my ninth decade, and I shall try to mention some of them. My wife, Dorothy, came down with cancer. We spent most of a year in treating the disease. Half of the year we drove to Zion, Ill. each month for a treatment. A couple of days after she seemed much improved and feeling well, she died.<br><br>I carried on as best I could, living alone in a family house. I associated with old friends and neighbors. I learned to cook for myself, being sure there were few leftovers. To avoid my own cooking, I arranged to have lunch weekly with Rose Marie, a widow known to me for half my life. She was good company and soon we had lunch together more than weekly. We also found it desirable to go other places such as concerts and plays together. We became pretty good friends.<br><br>About this time it became harder for me to read my paper. I needed a brighter light. The condition got worse as time went by. I eventually realized that I had macular degeneration and that it would get worse. It became clear that I couldn’t continue to safely run the household with bad vision. I needed to make different living arrangements. All my children visited and gave their evaluations of my dilemma. They all offered their help. Catherine suggested a trial run at her place which I accepted and found it to be the best fit for me. What made the real difference was I felt in my heart that she really wanted me to come and live with her. The decision made, I sold all the household goods and put the house up for sale. I had way too much help in selling the goods. I think my kids gave most of it away, including some things I wanted to keep. And so it happened that I landed in Lafayette, Louisiana. Soon Catherine saw that I needed a project to help keep me busy and I found myself enrolled in a Life Writing class. I wrote several stories and met a few interesting people, but not many life-changing events other the further loss of my vision occurred until near the end of the decade. On the second day of this year my youngest daughter Susanna lost her difficult battle with ovarian cancer. Then, with just five months to go I fell to the floor and broke both my arm and my leg. This put a sudden stop to my activities.<br><br>In due time I recovered enough to get around outside of my home, with help. Son David planned a family week at Tybrisa Beach. The response was feeble but Catherine and I planned to go anyway. When it came time to go our flight had been cancelled because the puny storm Lee interfered with a flight somewhere. This continued for a couple of days, as plans changed. We decided to go to Washington instead. Catherine and husband visited son Shawn and I visited, in Reston, Virginia, my son David, who had cut his beach vacation short. David celebrated my visit by taking me to see my first opera, Tosca. I couldn’t see the stage, and I don’t understand Italian, but the music came through loud and clear. I enjoyed it despite the obstacles, partly because the lady sitting next to me had seen many “Tosca’s and her comments were amusing.<br><br>On Sunday, 9/11/11 David started preparing a meal and during the morning people drifted in. I expected the local ones, but I was surprised to see my granddaughter Emily and her dad Dick from Florida. They came for the afternoon and left the next morning. It was wonderful to see them. The next surprise was granddaughter Alisa who seldom attends family gatherings. It was great to see her, too. By early afternoon there was a houseful of people present. There were my three surviving children, three spouses, six grand children and a great grandson. I was surprised yet again when I received a delightful call from my niece Rebecca.<br><br>David brought in a young woman to play her classical guitar for a couple of hours, to entertain us. Also there was a great reunion of cousins happening. We all gathered out on the patio for the meal prepared for us. Everyone ate heartily, after which all sang “Happy Birthday”. This pretty much ended my ninth decade although I really had two days to go. David charged the whole assembly to read the stories I wrote and ask me questions about anything I hadn’t made clear. Several folks said nice things about Old Dad; Alisa reminded me that I was Grandpa Pickenberry. Stephen baked my favorite cake, orange chiffon. It was a great sendoff to my tenth decade. I really don’t believe I’ll have a tenth decade. Few people do. But for the time being I will live like it’s a sure thing.<br><br>Present besides me: David &amp; Katyna, Andre &amp; Ursula and her friend Jonathan, Stephen, Alisa &amp; Beau, Logan, Catherine &amp; Ghulam, Shawn and his friend Adrienne, Dick, Emily	1	2017-04-22 18:22:50.609089	2017-04-23 00:12:22.043053	2011	1	\N	\N	\N	932	\N	\N
136	My Prayers	“Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray Thee Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray Thee Lord my soul to take.” This was my first prayer and that of millions of other children around the world. My momma taught me the prayer. It is a self-centered petition; but what else does a young child know? Even so, it speaks of the very essence of life, one’s soul. I guess it was hard for me to distinguish the difference between God and Santa Claus, but at least Momma had introduced me to God. By the way, some adults still have trouble distinguishing between God and Santa.<br><br>When my sister Margaret and I were older Momma had her family gather around her before bedtime for a little devotional period. She told us stories from the Bible, taught us some of her favorite verses from it, and some new ones. She read to us from the scriptures and prayed with us and urged us to pray prayers of thanks for God’s gifts to us. We didn’t always see our gifts coming straight from God but we thanked him anyway. We learned quite a bit from our sessions with Momma, to ask for help and forgiveness.<br><br>Momma seemed hell-bent on seeing to it that our souls were saved. Any time a church in town had a revival meeting we were sure to attend at least two or three meetings. She would always urge me to go shake the preacher’s hand during his alter call. I was reluctant to do it since I wasn’t sure just what it meant. I later found my own way to accepting the Lord’s invitation.<br><br>Many have been situations where I wasn’t sure how to go about overcoming obstacles in the way of a good or fair solution to a problem. I often prayed for God’s help and direction. I usually got a satisfactory solution to the problem. I could never feel sure that God helped me find an answer, but he gave me faith enough that I asked for his help time and again.<br><br>Other times I have been disappointed in answers to my prayers. Those answers were “no”. Those answers came in response to petitions that did not involve any effort of mine such as prayer for healing of “incurable” disease. Evidently it was not God’s will.<br><br>I have forgotten the details of all the Church services I ever attended, except for one. I remember only the last few minutes of that one. It was a Maundy Thursday service, commemorating Jesus’ last days of mortality. The service went on pretty much as expected, with scripture and homily, until near the end. Then the tolling of the bells began. The toll was a somber sound, repeating at a slow and steady pace. As the bell tolled the lights in the sanctuary dimmed. The symbolism was strong. My thoughts lead me to the garden where Jesus prayed while his disciples slept. As the lights dimmed I remembered what followed, how he was lead away to face his ordeal alone.<br><br>The bells continued to toll as the darkness advanced. I began to feel empathy for the man who had only love for his friends and all people, for one left alone without a person to give a word of encouragement. How awful a feeling and it was overcoming me. Soon the darkness was complete, except for a single candle that was extinguished as the tolling of the bells stopped and we were left in a world of darkness.<br><br>The feeling I had during the tolling stayed with me long after I got home that night. I have never felt as close to God as then. I didn’t think of the experience as prayer but I now think it was the most intimate prayer of my life.	1	2017-04-22 18:23:09.315153	2017-04-23 00:12:22.057969	2011	1	\N	\N	\N	668	\N	\N
137	Fog	As a young teenager I usually spent some summer weeks with Grandma Wells and Aunt Tump. Tump visited her friends and cousins and often took me with her. On one such occasion we spent the afternoon with her first cousin Eva and husband Joe. Joe was a mail carrier and a ham radio operator, so there was no problem in keeping me entertained. The afternoon flew by and it was at the edge of darkness before anyone noticed.<br><br>“We’d better get going,” said Tump “I don’t like driving over the mountain in the dark.”&nbsp;<br><br>“If you have a friend who’s a ham operator get with him and give me a call,” said Joe.<br><br>“All right, good to see you all again, bye” I said.<br><br>“I’ll see you again soon,” Tump said as we got in her car and she drove away toward Stone Mountain. The town where Eva and Joe lived is situated at higher elevation than is Tump’s place, which makes the down side a longer ride than the travel up. It was dusk by the time we reached the downward slope of the road. Everything looked fine to me. We had a competent driver and the road appeared in good shape ahead. It was typical twilight time and the headlights gave ample illumination.<br><br>We went down the mountain road for a mile or so, happy to be on the way home when our headlights seemed to get dimmer. Farther on they dimmed even more.<br><br>“I think we’ve run into fog,” Tump said.<br><br>“Yeah, it’s hard to see the road. Can you see it all right?” I said.<br><br>“Just barely. We should turn around and go back to Eva’s place for the night,” Tump said, “only there’s no place to turn around,” and she slowed our slow speed even slower.<br><br>“I believe I can walk faster than this,” I said, and she stopped the car.<br><br>“Good idea. I’m glad you thought of that. Want to get home tonight? If you’ll walk in the middle of the road I can follow and maybe stay on the road. What d’ya say?” What could I say? The next thing I knew I was hiking down the road ahead of the car in a fog so thick I could barely see the road right under my feet. I realized that I was having trouble staying in the middle of the road only when I heard the car horn toot.<br><br>“Can’t you stay in the middle of the road?”<br><br>“No, I can’t see where the middle is.” I had to change what I was doing so that I frequently stopped and paced off the distance from the edge to the middle of the pavement. We got along fine for a time after the adjustment. The most difficult part of my leadership role was on the curves of that mountain road. We continued on down the mountain for an hour or more and we came across a car in the ditch. The strange part of this scene was that we could see the car in the ditch. We had come out of the dense part of the fog. We had just come through a low hanging cloud. It is common for fog to form along the side of a mountain.<br><br>“See that car in the ditch? If it hadn’t been for your expert trailblazing we could have been that car.”<br><br>“Thank you,” I said, and we made our way the rest of the way down the mountain and all the way home the same day. Truth be known, the car was in the ditch when we went up the mountain. I wonder why Tump didn’t see it then.<br><br>RDJ Writing Notes:Tump and her favorite nephew Donald, after an afternoon visit with her cousin Eva are headed for home just before dark. Going down Stone Mountain they encounter a dense fog that presents them with a dilemma of how to get down the mountain while staying on the road. They take the only option available and Donald blazes a trail, which Tump follows and they get home safely.	1	2017-04-22 18:23:24.217645	2017-04-23 00:12:22.064887	2011	1	\N	\N	\N	730	\N	\N
138	Failure	Does anyone like to remember the things he failed at? Not likely. Some failures one can’t forget even if he tries but those are few. Most failures are put in the back of the mind and are forgotten because they are inconsequential. Others are too painful and are put aside in hope of forgetting. A failure I don’t mind sharing is that I was always a lousy history student.<br><br>History seemed irrelevant to me. It was about dead people. It was about remembering names, dates and wars. I was like the Hebrews; dates didn’t matter except in relation to other important events. What did all that stuff have to do with me, or the world I lived in? Perhaps an answer to this question would have generated some interest where none existed.<br><br>History required a lot of reading that always took a long time. I didn’t’ have the patience to read very long, especially something I wasn’t interested in. Reading was never one of my favorite endeavors. I need something early on to pique my interest or I am discouraged from continuing; it needs a hook, as I have learned. I suppose the real problem was that I was a slow reader. I saw print as words rather than phrases. This slowed down my speed.<br><br>I have no idea why I enrolled in a European history class as an elective as a student at Lincoln Memorial Universety. I remember only one thing from the class. Miss Lotspiech spoke of a painting by an artist who portrayed Moses without a beard. I asked if they had razors in Moses time. The only answer I got was a look of disdain. At that moment both she and I both knew that I was a failure as a history student. In the end however she was kind to me. She gave me a D, the lowest passing grade.<br><br>I transferred to the University of Kentucky to pursue an engineering degree. The generously given D turned out to be just a kindness. It was not transferable. In the end I had to take another course to make up for the deficit. It was not history. Because of the deficit I spent the summer after I should have graduated taking courses to complete requirements for a degree. The truth be known I would have taken summer school regardless of the non-transferable grade because I needed even more credits to graduate. So there was nothing lost.<br><br>Since my student days I learned that history does have consequences for future generations. That has not caused me to read history books. I believe historians are dull writers. There are writers who can write history as an interesting narrative. I have found a few such writers in recorded books and have actually enjoyed them.<br><br>Couldn’t the world be a better place by regarding history as a great teacher? Maybe so. But who’s paying attention?	1	2017-04-22 18:23:55.691867	2017-04-23 00:12:22.071548	2011	1	\N	\N	\N	504	\N	\N
139	Coach	Football was a game that I looked forward to playing once I reached high school. As a young boy I played tackle in someone’s yard with whomever we could round up for a game. I went home afterward dirty and grass stained much to the dismay of my mother. I couldn’t wait to grow up and play with the big boys on the high school team.<br><br>The day finally came that I reported for my first practice. I was issued a uniform that looked the worse for wear. Although it had been washed since the last season it still looked dirty from all its grass stains and ground in dirt. What more could I expect? I was just one of the scrubs. Dressed for battle I took to the field.<br><br>It was there that I first met Coach Grabruck though I had seen him in school. He was of medium stature and of good athletic build. He had recently played football for Center College at Danville, KY.&nbsp;<br><br>“All right boys, let’s warm up with some calisthenics,” Coach demanded after a shrill blast of his whistle. There followed a flurry of push-ups, knee-bends, torso-twists, running in place, et cetera. After an hour of warm-up, a lot for guys who took it easy all summer, Coach said, “Two laps around the field and to the showers.”<br><br>We were soon put to work learning the fundamentals of the game. We actually made contact with guys on the field, learning proper ways to block and to tackle the opponent. The game was played by different rules in the 1930’s. The biggest difference was that the players played both offence and defense. Substitution was limited. Any player might play the whole game. Now it takes an offensive team and a defensive team to meet an opponent.&nbsp;<br><br>As a scrub I never got into a game my first year. The only perk besides practice was getting dressed for the games and watching from the bench. During my sophomore year I was allowed to play for a few minutes before the end of a game where we led by a couple of touchdowns. I finally made the varsity team in my junior year.<br><br>Coach always encouraged the team to play hard and play to win.<br><br>“Football is a team sport,” Coach frequently emphasized. “You all have your individual job on every play and you have to work as a team. If one of you fails, then the play doesn’t work right. So study the plays and remember the team objective and your part in it.”<br><br>There was a legend that the Middlesboro team had never scored on our field. Before the game with them someone asked, “Coach, would you rather we would win 7 to 6 or tie 0 to 0?”<br><br>“Win, of course,” Came the reply without hesitation. We won that game 7 to 6<br><br>We were gathered for a big game. We were the underdogs. To conclude his pre-game pep talk Coach said, as on many occasions before, “Remember, a team that won’t be beat can’t be beat.” When we remembered, we won.<br><br>Coach always treated his players fairly. Everybody liked him. Guys hung around his office after practice until he said, “Don’t let the doorknob hit you in the tail as you leave.”<br><br>It was Coach’s solid leadership, his emphasis on fundamentals and teamwork plus a winning attitude that drove our team to the Cumberland Valley Conference championship in my senior year.<br><br>Things I learned from Coach Grabruck were not just about football. That was a minor and temporary part of the experience. These lessons carried over for a lifetime. Teamwork and the will to win were very important parts of my work experience, as well as of most other efforts. Coach was a greater part of my life than I realized. By the way, I managed to always avoid his doorknob.	1	2017-04-22 18:24:10.169413	2017-04-23 00:12:22.078381	2011	1	\N	\N	\N	685	\N	\N
140	Best Valentine	Greetings to my Best Valentine. I’m writing to you to thank you for being my best. I consider you my Valentine because it’s the season for such. Otherwise I just think of you as a loving daughter.&nbsp;<br><br>I well recall that you of all my offspring were the one who loved to sit on her daddy’s lap. Your siblings like to sit there too, but you enjoyed it and were in no hurry to move on. Of course as do most cute little people you grew up to be an adult and went on about your own business as normal folks do. You could have written more often but so could have I. Most all your adult life you’ve been a half orphan, which is a pity. You have always been close at heart to me.<br><br>Time takes it toll and I was on the brink of old age when you found out the truth about me. It wasn’t that I was feeble and needed help moving about. I was still able to do all my household chores although living alone. You realized, as I did, that things would soon change, that I would soon be a hazard to myself for lack of clear sight. I would have to get assistance one way or another.<br><br>You understood my dilemma. You invited me to come and live with you, and when I hesitated you offered me a trial run. I couldn’t refuse the offer so I tried it or a month or two. You provided me with a private room where I could hang out without feeling I was interfering with your family. I didn’t have to fix my own meals. I enjoyed my stay and within a few months I sold my house and moved in with you. I surely hope you have no regrets over the deal.<br><br>Even though I had plenty of qualms about leaving the place where I’d lived comfortably for sixty years you made me feel at home. One of the first things was to get me enrolled in the life writing class. I learned that I could write stuff though it is sometimes painful to start a piece. I’ve met some interesting people in the class. You connected me with Affiliated Bind, which has been a great help. Because of their help I have aids that enable me to do a lot of things that I couldn’t otherwise do.<br><br>It enriches my life and I think yours too when we go to symphony and band concerts together. I even like to go hear your Sweet Adelines. Oh yes, I think your participation is a good thing for you. And what about those warm nights when we sit in the back yard and sing silly songs! I guess I just enjoy being around you and whether we’re singing or eating one of your fine breakfasts.<br><br>Haven’t you spread the word around among the ladies that your dad is a good hugger? That’s fine with me. At times a woman comes out of a crowd headed straight for me with outstretched arms. Don’t worry.

141	Alma Mater	Assignment (as I understand it): Your alma mater has invited you to speak to them. What would you say?<br><br>Answer: No, thank you. The following, however, is the essence of what I might tell them.<br><br>Thank you for inviting me here to make a few remarks for the benefit of the new graduates of Podunk College. I must admit that I feel completely inadequate in advising you of what may be to your benefit. Things today are not as they were when I was in your position. I graduated into a world at war. Many industries had open positions in the face of a shortage of workers to fill those jobs. Choice of a job was pretty much up to the job seeker. Not so these days.<br><br>Unfortunately many young folks have been led to believe that a high paying job is waiting to be filled by a brand new graduate with a big student loan. The loan can be paid off in a couple of years with the high salaries. I say don’t be deceived by such nonsense. You have arrived at only the beginning of a life with much left to learn about yourself and those around you.<br><br>The biggest problem today as I see it is declining morality. Fraud and corruption are abundant. It’s hard to get far from it. Once, a man’s word was his bond. Trust is becoming a rare thing, and that’s a shame. Franklin or Jefferson, or another of the founding fathers said that for a republic to survive, it must have a strong moral fiber.<br><br>I challenge you to do all you can to improve the morality of the nation, starting with your own family of friends and associates. Love God and your neighbor.<br><br>Choose freedom. Beware of levying a tax on something simply because you personally don’t like it. Next time it may be one of your favorite things that’s taxed.<br><br>I imagine that few of you would be here today if you didn’t believe that a college diploma would help you to get a job, one that you want. Let me throw in my two cents. Think of what you love to do. Look for a job doing the thing you love. Don’t be afraid of a menial task. You may have to work at such a job while you are in pursuit of the job you really want.<br><br>The job you really love will likely bring you more self esteem and satisfaction than could be bought with thousands of dollars you might earn in your high paying job that seems like hard work. Let the pay be of secondary importance. In the words of Mark Twain, “Let your avocation be your vocation.”	1	2017-04-22 18:24:44.610518	2017-05-01 22:21:34.458831	2011	8	speaker.jpg	\N	Non-Fiction	477	Late	Letter
152	Foot of the Bed	When I was a boy, my family went away on occasions and left me in the care of my grand parents. At that time two aunts and two uncles lived at home with my grannies. I didn’t mind staying with them for a while. I had fun with my aunts and uncles. They all pampered me. I got to watch them milk the cows and they let me try. Of course I failed but it was fun trying. In the fall we would go to the woods to hunt chestnuts. I learned that the nuts came in a case of sharp burs.<br><br>The difficult part came at night. All their beds were full of people when it came sleepy time. So what were they going to do with me? I could spend the night on the floor on a thin pallet. I never slept well on the hard floor, and woke up crankier than anyone else. Well they came up with the solution. Did you ever sleep at the foot of a bed with people attached to the feet? Well it’s an experience. My aunts, being a little less bulky than my uncles, won the honor of my company for the night. The way this works is as follows: the corner of the quilt at the foot of the bed is turned up supposedly without disturbing the other two-thirds of the quilt. The occupant takes his pillow and carefully slides into the corner after the adults have taken their places. The adult bodies are skewed from their normal positions to make room for the intruder and might try assuming the norm sometime during the night, and so it behooves one to find something to hold onto in an emergency. With that bit of preparation thought out, one is now ready to relax and try to sleep.<br><br>During the night I have experienced a number of things that I never did while sleeping on the floor. But what the heck, the bed was a lot softer than the floor. Before I went to sleep I could not forget that a foot or two resided very close to my face and that a heel might come crashing into my nose with little warning. After more squirming than usual I went to sleep. The next thing I knew I was awakened by a slight pain in my shoulder. Did someone stab me with a knife? I couldn’t feel any blood so I figured that someone had not trimmed her toenails recently. Turnover time seemed pretty dangerous. I soon learned that it was best to turn when the others turned. This way I had a chance to recover my share of the quilt in case it was pulled off of me. Sleeping at the foot of the bed is not exactly ideal, but suppose I’d had to sleep in the middle.<br><br>Momma and Daddy soon returned to rescue me and asked, “Did you have a good time staying with Grandma and Grandpa?”<br><br>“Oh yes,” I said, “And I didn’t even fall out of bed.”	1	2017-04-22 18:49:14.196565	2017-04-23 00:12:22.111538	2012	1	\N	\N	\N	523	\N	\N
154	Detour	A person or more are traveling by automobile on Interstate 75 and in no particular hurry. Should they be in a hurry why didn’t they take to the air? Maybe it was just to avoid the hassle of boarding an airplane. There are many detours one can take between Miami and Michigan so I shall mention only two or three, so come with me and let’s explore a bit.<br><br>We leave I 75 and take US 25E. There are junctions in southern Kentucky and in northern Tennessee. Suppose we are headed to Cincinnati. As we move along the highway notice the pastoral scene. We’re in Powell Valley. We pass many family farms with crops and dairy cattle. Notice the red cedar trees. They grow almost everywhere that there’s no competition from plough or hoof. The trees are beautiful; they remind me of Christmas.<br><br>We will soon be at the state line. That will be Cumberland Gap. That’s where Daniel Boone crossed the mountains to explore Kentucky. They have built a tunnel under the mountain at that location, but we’ll take the old road over the mountain and explore the mountain-top.<br><br>The topmost point is called the Pinnacle. We’ll get out and look around. The view is spectacular looking across the valley and up the mountain range. There’s a town down there, Middlesboro. Follow me along this trail. Here we are. If you stand on the spot where the marker is you will stand in three states at one time: Kentucky, Virginia, and Tennessee.<br><br>When ready we’ll go on up the road about fifteen miles or so. We’ll see a sign directing us to Pine Mountain State Park in Kentucky. If we follow the directions we’ll find a parking lot and trails leading into the park. Be aware that the trails have stretches of steep grade, so if that is a problem we can confine our hike to a short easy walk. We can spend as much or as little time as desired.<br><br>Let’s take this trail. It will take us through some interesting places and to a chained rock. Notice the small plants on the ground under the trees. Depending on the season they will have blossoms such as jack-in-the-pulpit or columbine. Here is a spot where the forest is less dense. See the lovely green bed of moss. Care for a nap?<br><br>Farther up the trail we see the forest thin, replaced by shrubs. These are mainly mountain laurel and rhododendron. They bloom in spring and early summer. The mountain laurel produces a unique pink blossom. They appear in clusters of tiny Chinese-lantern like flowers. The flower was the inspiration for the Mountain Laurel Festival held each May in the nearby town of Pineville and in the park.<br><br>Follow me over here. The trails and footbridges were made by CCC boys about eighty years ago, so some things have changed in that time. Here they found a tree that had apparently been blown over against a cliff. Some enterprising person thought to make a living stairway by making the tree a part of the trail. Notice the steps cut into the wood, the concrete tread and the added handrail. We can continue on the trail via the tree or take the path around it. Either way we’re headed for the chained rock. Let’s go.<br><br>There is the rock just ahead. Let’s sit for a moment and catch our breath. Look at the size of that chain. How many mules do you suppose it took to drag that thing up here? I’ll bet they had to search the whole county to find enough for the job. Let’s go and take a closer look at the rock and chain. The rock is well embedded into the side of the mountain, and there is an overhang that can be seen from the valley below. The overhang is what makes the rock look so foreboding. Thus the chain is fastened to the rock where the overhang is visible from below. From here we can see the whole business district of the town of Pineville, so it’s a sure thing that the rock and chain can be seen from there, and it’s a sure thing that the Chamber of commerce saw it before it was chained. Well, it makes a good picture whether or not there is any truth in it.<br><br>We’re ready to head back down. We’ll follow the same trail for a way and then split off to a different trail to conclude our trek. Enjoy the scenery on the way down.<br><br>As we emerge from the forest we are surprised by the scene. Heavy boards sit in rows between big rocks. It’s an amphitheater. Look ahead. The aisle between the seats leads to a footbridge across a little stream that flows along the front of a stage that has a spectacular backdrop, which is a high sandstone bluff. Notice that the bluff is multilayered and shrubs grow between the layers. Much of the shrubbery is mountain laurel. When in bloom it dresses the backdrop in a gown that puts royalty to shame.<br><br>This is the place where the main event of the Mountain Laurel Festival takes place. Young women from colleges all over the state compete for queen of the Festival and one is crowned by the Governor.<br><br>The last leg of our little journey leads us down a very pleasant walk along the stream that marked the front of the stage that we just visited. It’s just a short easy walk to the parking lot. Just follow the highway through Pineville and on to the junction with I 75.&nbsp;	1	2017-04-22 18:49:47.364264	2017-04-23 00:12:22.127741	2012	1	\N	\N	\N	987	\N	\N
155	Who Turned My World Upside Down	As a happy 24-year-old I was thinking of finding a bride and starting a family. I had a job and though I had no money, the job would provide. World War II was over; I no longer had to fear the draft as an obstacle. Plenty available young women shared my ambitions, not directed at me, but they were out there. It was the normal and accepted way of life. No better way has been devised in thousands of years to rear children for future generations than through the commitment of a man and a woman in marriage.<br><br>The attitude among many people today is far different. Some couples prefer to live together without benefit of marriage, children be damned. Some couples delay having children so long that the woman is on the verge of being past child bearing age.<br><br>Still further from ideas of my youth are those of college students whose main political concern is same-sex marriage. Such word modifiers as same-sex simply corrupt our language. Marriage has always meant the union of a man and a woman. Here we have a conundrum. On one hand couples that ought to marry reject the idea, while on the other. some who have no right to do so demand it.<br><br>Aside from the marriage question, an over-the-hill professional athlete claims to be homosexual and he is applauded for his courage by the media and others. I remember when a person’s private life was kept private.<br><br>Here’s another upside down thing. The Affordable Health Care law, i.e. Obama Care, is a gigantic fraud. All who expect cheap or free health care are in for a rude awakening. The cost will be great in many more ways than just money. More of our freedoms bite the dust.<br><br>Aside from the damage already done many power-hungry people want constitutional rights only for themselves, for example the right to own fire arms and the right to free speech. The idea that disarming law-abiding citizens will prevent crazy predators from moving into gun-free zones and shooting innocent victims is absurd. The right to free speech may seem intact but consider the politically correct nonsense. This is obviously a scheme to control speech by limiting what may be said and changing the meaning of words. Whatever happened to the proper term illegal alien? It is referred to as undocumented immigrant. Is somebody afraid of insulting an alien?<br><br>I want to add just one thing more to my list of failures in our society. Terrorist attacks on civilians have caused much stress on people all over the land. Air travel is probably the most widespread inconvenience and time waster. The most recent attack shut down a whole million-person city for more than a day.<br><br>Who could be responsible for such a sorry state of affairs? The majority of Americans usually get what they want. Perhaps they lost sight of what they wanted. It could be that changes in behavior were too subtle for most to recognize. Maybe our public school system is to blame.<br><br>I don’t know who turned my world upside down but I have an idea that for whatever reason, too many people have been apathetic.	1	2017-04-22 18:58:12.534188	2017-04-23 00:12:22.134427	2013	1	\N	\N	\N	551	\N	\N
156	The Football Hero	In the Great Depression people were eager to see a hero of any sort. They went to movies with heroic themes. High school football was a favorite escape in Pineville where I grew up, as in many other places no doubt.<br><br>Football was a different game in those days than it is now. Players played both offence and defense. Substitution was limited. Once a player left the game he could not return in the same quarter of play. A team could have triple-threats who could run, pass and kick the ball.<br><br>Red Harp was a triple-threat who played quarterback on the Pineville High School team in the early 1930s. The team was just average during Red’s time, winning just about half their games. One sunny Friday afternoon the team was playing pretty well with few mistakes. In the third quarter Pineville intercepted a pass and ran it back for good field position. Red gained a few yards and followed with a pass to an end for a touchdown to tie the score. The kickoff left the visitors with the ball on their thirty yard line. Play continued with each team possessing the ball but making no progress toward scoring. Red made a spectacular end run, but to no avail. Progress was stopped there. Pineville had the ball near midfield. Red called the play and must have had a lapse of memory and messed up the play, losing fifteen yards and bringing up fourth down and twenty yards to go for the first down. Red’s punt left the ball in the opponents’ hands on their own thirty-five yard line. There they seemed to get their second wind, and started moving the ball down the field. Their ruling plays netted twenty yards and they added twenty-five more yards via passes. The onslaught continued from Pineville’s twenty yard line until they reached the nine. Pineville called time out and regrouped, realized their situation and ended the time out with great determination to stop them from scoring. They were pretty sure to try for a touchdown because they didn’t have a good kicker.<br><br>True to the calculations, the next plays all tried for a touchdown. The first of the series netted in a three yard loss. A pass to the end zone was incomplete. Two running plays advanced the ball to the one and a half yard line where the Pineville line held fast<br><br>It was Pineville’s ball but there was little room to develop a play. To be sage Red called for a punt hoping to get out of danger. On signal the center snapped the ball which came toward Red, but off course so that Red had to step to one side to catch it. That step broke his rhythm so that Red had no time to reset for a kick. There was only one thing left to do; he had to find a path across the scrimmage line with the ball. He found a small opening in the line, moved through and began dodging tacklers. Having dodged two or three he simply outran the others for a touchdown. As it turned out Red got possession of the ball just a yard inside the out-of-bounds line.<br><br>His touchdown run was a conference record 109 yards!&nbsp;<br><br>People did not remember Red Harp’s stellar performance in his other years on the team, or even other games this banner year. People didn’t remember which team won the 109 yard game, or what team Pineville played that day, or indeed who won the game. Nevertheless there are folks around who after more than eighty years remember the name Red Harp and his amazing touchdown run.	1	2017-04-22 18:58:29.65501	2017-04-23 00:12:22.141072	2013	1	\N	\N	\N	629	\N	\N
157	Pittsburgh Misfit	Graduates of the College of Engineering at the University of Kentucky in 1943 were few indeed. Westinghouse men interviewed graduates and hired me. They directed me to report at the Educational Center in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania in about a week.<br><br>I arrived at the Center on schedule wearing my lone suit with pants seat worn thin enough to show the color of my under shorts. It was an exciting day for a young fellow. We were given the lowdown on our location and our purpose in being at the Center. The first order of business was to get all the new hires settled into living quarters. I arrived at Mr. and Mrs. Smith’s house in Wilkinsburg, bag in hand. The Smiths provided board and room for as many as half a dozen men. I was readily accepted as a member of a congenial family. The Smith house was located among many others that burned coal for heat. Needless to say I needed to find laundry service quickly.<br><br>We spent our first week with the Company at the Educational Center. Men from various divisions of the Company came to the Center during that week to tell us of their products and the kind of engineering work they did. This gave us a good idea of how to better fit into the workforce. I listened to several of the presentations and made my choice. I got three one month assignments at the Pittsburgh facility and one month at Lima, Ohio.<br><br>My first assignment was at the East Pittsburgh plant where I arrived by street car after a half hour ride. I was really amazed by the size of the factory and the mass of people arriving at work. I followed the crowd in and the receptionist saw to it that I was escorted to my workplace. Someone showed me to a desk and handed me a clean rag. It was easy to see what the rag was for. The morning ritual saw me wiping the chair and the desk, and then sitting down. Even so I left with blackened shirt sleeves. I spent most of my day in the test lab where one expected it to be dirty.<br><br>The next assignments were at the research labs located in clean, air conditioned buildings, away from the factories. I don’t remember learning much, but I enjoyed my two months at the labs. I even enjoyed a little social life during lunch hour. Living in Pittsburgh was a mixed bag. I liked the area where Pittsburgh University is located, but I despised trying to get around downtown. The triangular blocks made the streets most confusing to a poor boy from a little town in the hills of Kentucky. I had some doubts about fitting in, especially since it was such a dirty city. It was cleaned up in due course, starting with the steel mills. I hoped for an environment more to my liking with my next assignment at Lima.<br><br>I bid farewell to my Pittsburgh friends and boarded the early morning train for Lima. It was still early when I arrived at the Lima plant, a much smaller facility than the East Pittsburg factory. The air was clear and crisp while abundant frost covered everything in sight. I later found that the town was laid out rectangular so that I could learn my way around without much trouble.<br><br>B. O. Austin, the man who made the presentation at the Educational Center showed me around and got me settled in his section. One of his group took me under his wing and taught me the ropes for the next month. By that time I had decided that I would like to work with these men. They were doing the kind of work that I would enjoy.<br><br>Not more than two or three weeks after I signed on I received a greeting from Uncle Sam. After my tour of duty in the Army I returned to Lima, resumed my job, married, reared a family and stayed on the job for 49 years and liked doing it. I thought I fit a place in life pretty well.	1	2017-04-22 18:58:54.328017	2017-04-23 00:12:22.147567	2013	1	\N	\N	\N	705	\N	\N
158	Old Pictures	Looking at old pictures I see things that are sort of familiar or perhaps ought to be. For instance here is one taken in the front or side yard of an old house. I see shades of gray in broad outline except for things that are familiar such as faces and certain shapes. I depend on the vision of others to identify for me other shapes. That’s how I determined that the picture was taken in the yard of an old house. The house appears in one corner of the picture. My vision person described the house just as I remember Grandpa Wells’ house. The reason for the photograph is a woman standing cheek-to-cheek with a handsome year old child in her arms. One can’t blame a woman for wanting to cuddle with such a precious, loveable child.<br><br>The woman is my Aunt Tump, a woman of ample girth dressed in a long dress that barely exposes the ankles. To the back and to one side of the picture is an unidentifiable woman looking on while shading her face from the sun and wearing the same style long dress. She could be the child’s mother.<br><br>If the child is, as I suspect, yours truly, then the picture was taken about 1923. Tump was a young school teacher just starting a lifelong career. She taught elementary grades where she was assigned. She loved kids. It’s plain from the picture that the women of this family were not of the flapper crowd. The child is clothed in a dress; yes, girl’s clothes. That’s how it was so long as a child was in diapers. My boys got to wear modified dresses. Some smart person invented snaps that could close the botton of a dress-like garmet to make it look like pants. I was a proud wearer of the dress, just like my sister.<br><br>I found an interesting picture in my archives that shows a group picture of my Jessee Grandparents’ family at some time during their lives. Both of my Jessee Grandparents died before I started to school. I recognize the family because I remember seeing pictures of both grandparents copied from the group picture. A second clue is Daddy, number thirteen in his family, at perhaps twelve years, along with his brother, Uncle Emory a couple of years older. The picture is set in front of a house with a large porch. Most of the people are standing on the ground in front of the porch. Young people sit on the steps leading to the porch.<br><br>It must have taken a month of planning to get ready for this picture. There are the two young boys and eleven adults including the parents. One woman brought three little children to the party. Everybody was dressed in their Sunday best and most of them came from different farms around the county. The men wore suits of homespun wool, the scratchy kind. Granddad kept sheep on his farm for the wool, and had all the necessary tools to produce the cloth. There is no one around to identify those in the picture. I guess the women are my aunts. Aunt Becky got enough cloth to make herself a new dress in bold stripes and one for her little daughter.<br><br>Judging from the size of my dad I’d guess that the picture was taken about 1903, The faces all look rather stern as if the photographer had said “Don’t move until I say it’s all right.” The main thing I take from the picture is that Granddaddy James Abel Jessee ran a good farm and stocked it with good workers.&nbsp;	1	2017-04-22 18:59:09.487261	2017-04-23 00:12:22.154118	2013	1	\N	\N	\N	625	\N	\N
159	My Favorite Pet	I live here alone now. I need some clean clothes. I gather my dirty duds and go to the basement. I sort the clothes and put a load into the washing machine. Something reminds me of my little dog, Dinah.<br><br>I just arrived home from work and saw the poor little pup that Mardelle had brought home to look after until it was big enough to eat solid food. It looked so pitiful I couldn’t resist picking it up. It looked cold. It had been rescued from a shoe box abandoned in a yard on a cold night. I held it in my hand against my warm belly. It quit shivering. It would have purred had it been a kitten.<br><br>Wups, I ought to wash the sheets on my bed. I stop the machine and go after my sheets. I readjust the water level and stuff the sheets into the machine and resume the washing. I must go bring the mail in. I’m still thinking of the poor pup.<br><br>The pup looked so relaxed that I took to doing the warm-up trick every night when I got home. I kept up the routine until Mardelle quit bottle-feeding the pup. It was then that I realized that I like this little pup who thought I was her mother. We kept her and named her Dinah. When she grew up she still thought I was her mother. When I returned home after a day or two away she followed me around for all the next day, not letting me out of her sight.<br><br>I must get back down and tend my laundry. I believe the wash is done. Down the stairs I go and yes it is finished. Now I put these clothes in the drier. I load the washer with the rest of my dirty clothes and let the washer go to work.<br><br>In my neighborhood was a big collie that walked up the road and back home every day. Dinah was usually in the house or in the fenced-in back yard. Sometimes I brought her out front. If the collie happened to walk by our house Dinah let the collie know to stay on the other side of the road. Dinah had a commanding bark when defending her territory. The collie obliged.&nbsp;<br><br>It just so happens that I have a batch of wine fermenting and it is about ready to be racked, that is, the wine siphoned from the fermented fruit. While I’m waiting for the clothes to dry I shall rack the wine. It smells so good when it’s fermenting; it’s worthwhile to make a gallon just for the aroma that fills the basement.<br><br>Another time Dinah was with me while I was trimming shrubs out front next to the house. She seemed to be minding her own business when she spotted the neighbor’s dog, a German shepherd of ill repute. He had killed cats, but Dinah didn’t know that. She evidently thought he was on her territory and so began her “get off my land” bark. The shepherd taking umbrage with the threat, came over and bit Dinah, whose bark changed to a “yip yip yip”. The neighbor came over and called off the dog. I think the neighbor got rid of his dog soon after that.<br><br>I’ve finished racking the wine and the clothes drier has finished its cycle. I take the load out and put the next load from the washer in to dry.<br><br>One day I was sitting out doors with Dinah when a young half grown black cat walked by. It had not gone far past us when Dinah noticed the cat and started to charge after it. The chase ended abruptly when the cat turned to face Dinah with a hiss. Both cat and dog resumed their endeavors and all was peaceful again.<br><br>One day in my back yard I discovered that an intruder had visited and might still be with me. The unmistakable underground path of a mole stretched from one side of the yard to the other. I collapsed his tunnel by walking on it. I discovered that it wasn’t just one tunnel but that it had branches, so I recruited the help of Dinah. I let her out into the yard and showed her the area where I thought the mole was. She sniffed around for a minute or two and then started digging out the tunnel. A few seconds of digging and she was shaking the stuffing out of a fat mole. She looked pleased with her effort and I was very pleased with her.<br><br>Well, my dryer has stopped; time to go back to the basement to finish my laundry and let my machines rest for a couple of weeks.	1	2017-04-22 18:59:24.983114	2017-04-23 00:12:22.160866	2013	1	\N	\N	\N	824	\N	\N
160	Musings of Childhood	As a young child I heard talk of Reds (i.e. communists), coal mine slate falls, suicides, hard times, hobos and depression. I didn’t know the meaning of any of this until my dad lost his job and had to move to Kentucky to find another. It was only then that I realized that things had changed, for my family left me with grandparents until I could finish third grade.<br><br>In my preschool life I was a favored child. Living near my grandparents, with aunts and uncles gave me a leg up, not to mention that I was the first grandchild on my mother’s side. I suppose that I must have been at least a little bit spoiled and perhaps overprotected.<br><br>I didn’t like the idea of going off to school. I liked my life as it was and I wasn’t ready for a change, especially since my uncle, a teenager, teased me about having to go. I went just the same. The next three years seemed like the dumbest of my life. Lots of the other boys had older brothers to help them be wiser than us first-borns. They knew the rules to games we played and how to win. I have to give the schools of my youth credit for having recess. It gave the kids a break from their routine to get some fresh air and exercise. Recess no doubt helped prevent obesity so rampant today, so the story goes. It’s too bad that nearly all elementary schools have eliminated recess from their schedules. Recess was my favorite subject, er activity, in grammar school.<br><br>Leaving Grandma to join my family in Kentucky was a bittersweet move. I enjoyed living with Grandma, a very good friend. Except for leaving her, I was glad to go live with my family. At least they wouldn’t call me Bulldog. I wasn’t happy about the way I got that name, crying over lost marbles.<br><br>My musings were interrupted by the arrival of some of my progeny. My firstborn son, David, came and stayed for nine days. That was a major interruption, especially since he volunteered to move all my stuff from one room to another where I now reside. The quarters are better and may soon look better, but I don’t know where anything is, except for the big stuff. When that dude gets started on a project there’s no stopping him.<br><br>He wasn’t the only diversion. He was delayed for more than a day in beginning his task by the arrival of my granddaughter, Rachel, her husband Matt, and their two little daughters, Ava and Jane. They were on a farewell tour of friends and relatives prior to leaving for Scotland where they expect to start a new church. I can’t remember seeing two happier youngsters. It was a pleasure to have them around, at least for a little while.<br><br>It looks like I’ve lost my musing on scenes from my childhood.

164	Summer Tour 1928	“All right kids let’s load up this old Model T touring car. We’re just about ready to roll. It’s such a lovely summer day. We won’t need the mica windows to keep out the rain,” Daddy said.<br><br>“Last one in’s a doodle bug.”<br><br>“Mama’s the bug.”<br><br>“How far is it Daddy?”<br><br>“About 25 miles. We ought to be there in about an hour.”<br><br>“The breeze sure feels nice in my hair.”<br><br>“I hear a train whistle.”<br><br>“Yeah, and there’s a railroad crossing just ahead. We’ll have to stop and wait.”<br><br>“It had 24 cars. All loaded with coal.”<br><br>“Now we can go again. Are we just about there yet?”<br><br>“No, we’re not just about there yet. We’re just about half way there yet. Looks like road work ahead. Detour road closed.”<br><br>“Wow, look at that skinny dirt road.”<br><br>“Looks kind of steep. Well, we’ll try to make it. Oops, we’re stalled. We’ll have to ease back and try again. Everybody out and walk to the top. It’s only 30 yards or so.”<br><br>“He made it farther but he stalled again. Come on you guys let’s give him a push,” a road worker said.<br><br>“Thanks men for the push. It could have been worse. It could have been raining. Let’s be on our way. Get in.”<br><br>“That was exciting. I thought we’d have to turn around and go back home.”<br><br>“We’re in Scott County now. It won’t be too long now.”<br><br>“All right, we’ll just sit back and enjoy the ride.”<br><br>“Here’s where we turn off for Liesh Hill’s farm. He married Lettie, my sister Becky’s daughter. The house is just around the bend.”<br><br>“Well it’s Uncle Ike, and he’s brought his family with him. Howdy Uncle Ike,” Lettie said as she came out of the house, “I heard you coming and came outside to see who it was, and I was pleasantly surprised.”<br><br>“Hello Lettie, how have you been?” Dad said as he got out of the car and gave her a big hug.<br><br>“Howdy Aunt Ivo and Children. Come in. Mother’s inside.”<br><br>“Hello Isaac and Ivo, and Children,” Aunt Becky said among more hugs.<br><br>“Hello”<br><br>“Hello, Aunt Becky.”<br><br>“Liesh is out in the field. He’ll be back here for dinner about noon,” Lettie said, “The children are playing out in the back yard. Come on Ralph Donald and Margaret, I’ll introduce you to them.”<br><br>“We’re playing hide and seek. Sara’s it,” said Bud, and after a few rounds said to me, “The girls are doing fine, let’s take a walk.”<br><br>“Where are we going?”<br><br>“Over yonder, not very far, just up the hill past the tobacco patch.”<br><br>“It’s pretty out here. The tobacco is in bloom.”<br><br>“Yeah, the bloom has to be cut off before they go to seed.”<br><br>“Ah, there’s a big patch of green leaves ahead. Pumpkins?”<br><br>“No, watermelon.”<br><br>“All sizes of melons in there among those big leaves. I can see some blossoms hiding in there.<br><br>“Here’s one that looks ripe,” said Bud as he bent down and picked it off the vine.<br><br>“It’s not as big as I expected a ripe one to be.”<br><br>“This is a medium sized variety. They don’t get much bigger than this,” Bud said as the melon slipped from his grasp and lay broken on the ground.<br><br>“Oops, too bad.”<br><br>“Maybe not so bad. Let’s see what we can save of it,” said Bud and picked up a piece of the broken melon, red and adorned with little black jewels, and handed it to me.<br><br>“Man that’s good. You meant to drop it didn’t you?”<br><br>“Yeah.”<br><br>“I’ve had watermelon before, but never anything like this. It’s warm from the sunshine and sweet and delicious. People buy a melon after plugging it to see if it’s ripe, chill it, slice it and sprinkle salt on it before they eat it. It’s nothing to compare with this.”<br><br>“I’m glad you like it. Have another chunk,” and we sat down and finished the whole thing, leaving behind only the broken shell. Two young boy, completely satisfied, returned to their families.<br><br>“Well, did everybody enjoy our tour today?” Dad asked.<br><br>“It was a good tour. The exciting part was getting stuck and having to walk part way.”<br><br>“Our trip back should be easier. The steep part of the detour is downhill on our way back.”<br><br>“The detour problem will be hard to forget,” I said “but I’ll always remember the watermelon patch and its delicious taste.”	1	2017-04-22 19:01:00.999227	2017-04-23 00:12:22.183204	2013	1	\N	\N	\N	879	\N	\N
167	A Day at Granny's	Going to Granny’s was always a special treat for my children so long as they could play outdoors. There were so many things they could get into. They all liked to play near or in the little creek.<br><br>Bess lived just outside of Lima, Ohio on a 5-acre plot, bisected by a drainage ditch referred to by the inhabitants as a creek. The house and yard were west of the ditch while to the east was an apple orchard. On a few days in May when the orchard bloomed the sight and smell of it were too delicious to be ignored. The gravel driveway just west of the house was flanked by a row of three or four black walnut trees. The house was a wood frame structure painted white. It had a full front porch. Bess’s flower garden lay between the house and the creek. A foot-bridge connected the back yard and the orchard.<br><br>Most of the trees in the orchard were Jonathan that ripened at the end of summer. There were however a few trees of Early Transparent that were ripe by mid-summer. These provided an early treat for kids who couldn’t wait for the Jonathans to get ripe. The Early Transparent were great for making apple sauce, easily kept frozen.<br><br>We hadn’t come to Granny’s this day on a strictly social visit. I had bought a dozen fryer-sized chickens from one of Bessie’s neighbors for our freezer. While the kids started on their exploring the grounds once again, I got ready to decapitate my chickens. I fetched the chickens from the neighbors and got ready to go to work. Ordinarily I would need an ax and a chopping block, but having neither, I armed myself with a sharp knife and Bessie’s clothes line. I also had a tub of scalding water handy.<br><br>I began the operation by hanging a chicken by its feet to the clothes line, grasping the head and slicing it off. Hanging on the line it could bleed properly without flopping all over the yard. After the headless body became still I took it off the line and dunked it into the scalding water to loosen the feathers. After plucking the bird I held it over a lit crumpled sheet of newspaper to singe the hairs off the skin. By the time I singed all of the chickens my arms had also been singed. Having prepared the naked bird I took it in to Mary who finish by removing the entrails.<br><br>Repeating the process with each chicken, plus replenishing the scalding water now and then, we had a dozen chickens ready for our freezer. I don’t remember what we did with the feathers but, having no pigs to feed, we buried the guts as far from the house as possible.<br><br>Despite their preferred activates, the children could not help notice what their daddy was doing, murdering all those beautiful chickens.<br><br>They took a dim view of it.<br><br>“Well I guess we’re done here. Let’s go home,” I said.<br><br>“Not so fast,” Bessie said, “You’ll need to eat your supper first. Anybody for fried chicken?”<br><br>Before they finished their meal all the children had forgiven their daddy of murder.	1	2017-04-22 19:19:48.239252	2017-05-01 22:07:38.875331	2012	3	apples.jpg	Lima, Ohio	Non-Fiction	565	Middle	Story
165	The Ring	“Whatcha looking for? Did you drop something?” Catherine said as she saw me looking around my feet on the rug under them.<br><br>“It’s just a ring that fell off my finger. I think it’s the wedding ring your mother gave me. I found it among some odds and ends unearthed during my last move. My finger must have shrunk since I wore it last, so it fell off my finger onto the floor. I found it there. It’s 14K gold. It should be worth something,” I replied.<br><br>“Let me see it,” she said and I handed it to her. She gave the ring a thorough inspection and said, “There is an inscription on the inner surface of the ring. It says ‘love’, then there’s a blank space and then something else I can’t read.”<br><br>“That won’t affect the value of the gold,” I said.<br><br>“I want it,” she said before we could discuss the matter any further.&nbsp;<br><br>“It’s yours,” I said, thinking that she had a better “odds and ends” place than I could come up with. She might even have a special place to keep special treasures.<br><br>“What happened to the inscription?” she said.<br><br>“Now that’s a sad story, I said. “A bunch of young bucks, mostly a little younger than I, signed up to play in a Church softball league. They convinced me to join them. ‘It would be fun, you know.’ I had played in a softball game only a few random times before, in friendly games of course.<br><br>The games were scheduled once or twice a week after work. In our first game I learned that these were not your typical friendly games. My first time at bat had me wondering how in the world a guy could get so much speed on a ball pitched underhanded. Needless to say I struck out a lot. My work at fielding the ball bore similar results, never mind that I didn’t have a glove. It got so that I hoped for rain before game time.”<br><br>“Why did you keep on playing the game if you didn’t like it?” she said.<br><br>“Oh, I don’t know. I guess to quit would have been more embarrassing than bad play. I thought I had improved slightly and was really getting into the game, but maybe not. I was playing in the infield, the batter hit the ball at me, I almost caught the ball but it hit my finger and bent it toward the back of my hand. The offended finger was the one wearing the ring that should have been removed before the game started, but you live and learn.”<br><br>“I’ll bet that hurt.”<br><br>“I’ll bet you’re right! But I put the pain out of mind and went on with the game until the end. It wasn’t until maybe 2:00AM that the injured finger started to really bother me. That’s when the throbbing pain woke me. The knuckle had swollen so that the ring couldn’t be removed. Well, it had to be removed which meant cutting the ring to open a way out. I found a triangular file and sawed though the ring, gold dust flying. The inscription didn’t survive the cut. At any rate I was able to get it off my finger and allow the knuckle to swell unrestricted. It took several days for the knuckle to return to almost normal size. Many months later it looked as if I could wear the ring again so I brought it out of hiding and took it to a jeweler who repaired it, sans inscription.”<br><br>“I’m glad you got it repaired and continued to wear it”, she said, “What happened to your softball games after that?”<br><br>“Of that I have no recollection,” I said.<br><br>I supposed that Catherine had found a good place for her new treasure, and was about to ask her about it, but that turned out to be unnecessary when I discovered the ring on her middle finger.	1	2017-04-22 19:01:17.639425	2017-04-23 00:12:22.189767	2013	1	\N	\N	\N	711	\N	\N
168	The Truck	Telling the story of a Christmas day would be like telling the story of almost any other Christmas day. I can remember them only as Christmas days, not specific to any Christmas day. Of course there were specific events that I can recall but I can’t relate them to any particular time. That said, there are a few events that stand out in my mind.<br><br>Long ago, before I had to settle down and go to school, I noticed the fall and winter Sears Roebuck catalog came in the mail. Looking through it revealed to me knowledge I could not gain elsewhere. I found Santa’s complete list of offerings in full color. Needless to say, I studied the list thoroughly, except for the girly stuff. I prepared for Christmas for what seemed like months. I remember the year I found a truck that I could ride and haul my stuff in. Early on I let it be known that I wanted Santa Claus to bring me a truck for Christmas. I failed to show my parents a picture of the truck I wanted. There was only one truck shown in Santa’s list. I thought I was all set for Christmas and Santa’s visit.<br><br>The days passed slowly as I looked forward to Santa’s visit. I kept busy much of the time looking through Santa’s list which I nearly wore out. On Christmas Eve I worried that Santa wouldn’t come because we didn’t have a chimney for him to come down. Mama assured me that they would leave the front door unlocked so that he could get in. Her assurance eased my worries enough that after a while I went to sleep.<br><br>Morning came early for me and I wasted no time in getting myself out of bed and to the Christmas tree. I looked around and around but saw nothing of my truck.<br><br>“Merry Christmas!” said Mama.&nbsp;<br><br>“I can’t find my truck,” I said.&nbsp;<br><br>“There’s your truck, Honey right under the tree.”<br><br>“That little thing? I can’t ride in that, or haul anything.”<br><br>“You said that you wanted a truck and Santa brought you one. You didn’t say anything about riding it.”<br><br>About then Daddy walked in and said,”Santa Claus is smarter than you thought. If he’d brought you a riding model you would have been disappointed because you don’t have a place to ride it. Look out here. You could ride only 40 feet, then there’s not room to turn around. Be happy with the sturdy cast iron job. You have a ready built road on top of the concrete retaining wall.”<br><br>We lived in the country where there were no sidewalks for kids to play on. What my daddy told me made sense and I was able to accept it, but not until after a period of disappointment. I learned a lesson from the experience; in the future I always made sure that my parents knew exactly what I wanted. My wish had blotted out reality from my mind.<br><br>When the weather warmed I took the little cast iron monster outside and tried it out on the concrete road and hauled stuff there for the next three or four years.	1	2017-04-22 19:20:04.330524	2017-04-23 00:12:22.196248	2012	1	\N	\N	\N	572	\N	\N
170	Life with Mary 2	With four young children not yet in school Mary was a full-time mother as well as a wife. There were meals, diapers, laundry, skinned knees, hugs and kisses, grocery lists, trips to the doctor, and on and on. She was ever grateful that Granny was happy and eager to tend to the kids occasionally to give her a break from her daily routine. Mary took the opportunity to spend a little time with her friends, go shopping or whatnot. It seemed that she was always ready for bed at bedtime. She was always ready to get breakfast for me next morning to help me get to work. Folks who knew Mary shook their heads in wonder at how she managed her task. I too sometimes wondered how she did it.<br><br>Despite their mother’s loving, tender care, the kids were not perfect. As they grew to school age, flaws began to develop. Some of the flaws were tonsils large enough to impede swallowing of food, thumb sucking, bed wetting now and then, too many teeth that crowded each other into crookedness and a few others. Besides these kid problems, Mary had her own. Her teeth were not good and she ended up with dentures long before she was old enough to be a grandma. We managed to get most of our major flaws corrected and live a pretty much normal life.<br><br>Once the children were in school Mary had time to do more of the things she liked to do. She liked to sew. She made clothes particularly, but not exclusively, for our little girls. She made matching outfits for the girls; things not found in the stores. She made sport jackets for the boys. Heck, she even made one for me.&nbsp;<br><br>Still, Mary’s priority was the children. She paid close attention to their progress in school. She dragged me to all the PTA meetings and she knew the teachers. She even baked cakes for PTA bake sales. I thought such sales were useless. It would have been a lot easier to ask for a dollar donation and not have to bake a cake, or eat someone else’s stuff. I guess the women had a different take on the bake sale.<br><br>Supper time was always family time at our house. We discussed all kinds of problems involving family life. Nobody left the table without being excused. When I asked about what happened at school or what new thing somebody learned or what exciting thing happened I usually got the same reply, ”nothing”. Nobody wanted to repeat their earlier story, already told to Mom in great detail before I got home. I had to talk to Mom later to get their stories.<br><br>R. C. Hoiles, owner of the local newspaper as well as several others, often wrote editorial pieces for his paper. A proposed new library came up for a vote. Hoiles strongly opposed its public financing. His opposition was enough to get it approved by a large margin. The library became known as the house that Hoiles built. Hoiles also editorialized against public schools. Mary thought the local schools, though not perfect, were all right and served the community pretty well, and the local people were in charge.<br><br>Mary wrote a letter to the paper, challenging Hoiles on his stance on public schools. Little did she know that Hoiles was in town, but she soon got a phone call requesting a talk with her. Next evening he showed up, ready to straighten her out. For more than an hour they discussed and argued the topic of public schools. At length they finished in a draw. Neither’s mind was changed at all, but they had a good argument. I tended to agree with Mary mostly because the schools were locally controlled. If I heard the argument today I would agree with Hoiles on more of his points simply because federal government and unions are so involved.<br><br>As our boys became of age, they joined the Cub Scouts. It wasn’t long before the Cubmaster retired. Scout leadership depends on parents to serve in those positions and I was nominated as the new Cubmaster, a job I held for ten years. Meanwhile the girls grew to the age of Girl Scout Brownies and of course just had to join. As with Boy Scouts, leadership of Girl Scouts came from the parents, namely mothers. Of course Mary got involved, but not as a troop leader. She took training to learn to train troop leaders. She continued the effort so long as the girls were in Scouting. This took her to national conferences, one in Florida where she incidentally went deep sea fishing. She actually caught a fish, a marlin I think. She probably learned something about leader training too.<br><br>Each summer I saw to it that the family took a vacation trip. Usually, but not always, we went on camping trips. We went to various state parks over the years and simply stayed for a week, enjoying the features of the parks. Other times we took extensive tours, camping along the way. Our longest tour lasted a month and took us to the great national parks in the west from Grand Canyon north to Yellowstone and many points along the way. Mary had not camped before her experience with the family but she soon became a fine camper and loved it.<br><br>Mary recognized the shortcomings of how reading was taught in schools and sought improvements in the methods. Seems that the gaze and guess method was prevalent where kids were expected to memorize words by their shapes. If they learned the sounds that letters represent then many words could be identified simply by sounding out the letters. She joined three other women, another Mary, Sally and Jane and set out to promote phonetics as a reading method. They even engaged a teacher from Xavier University of Cincinnati to help them promote phonetics among the educators. Sister Monica spent a week with our family while helping the women.<br><br>The phonetics group went to conferences at the state capital to promote their idea. Arriving home from one such meeting Mary offered her hand declaring that the Governor had shaken it. I said that I would shake the hand provided she had washed her hands since the handshake. I didn’t like a governor so eager to raise my taxes as Celeste.<br><br>Mary continued with her mission so long as her health permitted. She never finished her work, but she made her voice heard so long as she could.	1	2017-04-22 19:20:50.228123	2017-04-23 00:12:22.212063	2010	1	\N	\N	\N	1119	\N	\N
171	Playthings	“I’m tired of playing video games and computer stuff, Grandpa. Did you ever get bored with video games when you were a kid?” said Sonny.<br><br>“Believe it or not I was once a kid, but I never got tired of playin’ video games. There were no such things then,” I said.<br><br>“Then what did you have to play with?” Sonny asked.<br><br>“Not very much,” I said. “I used to be excited when the Sears Roebuck fall and winter catalog came in the mail. I loved to open it to the toy section and plan what to ask Santa Claus to bring me.”<br><br>“What did you ask for?”&nbsp;<br><br>“I saw a toy truck, the kind I could ride in, and make go with pedals.”<br><br>“Did he bring you one?”<br><br>“He brought me a truck, but not one I could ride. It was about a foot long and made of cast iron. Oh well, I didn’t really have a place to ride it; no sidewalks.”<br><br>“But you played with it didn’t you?”<br><br>“Oh yes. We lived close to my grandma’s house. Her yard had a section that sloped upward from the main part of the yard with some big lilacs on the slope. There was bare ground under the lilacs where I thought it would be neat to build a road for my truck. Grandma let me build a road there. It was great fun to play in real dirt.”<br><br>“Sounds like a lot of fun. I never had a place like that to play in the dirt; can’t mess up the lawn.”<br><br>“When I got a little older an uncle showed me some tricks with wood that I could get for free.”<br><br>“What kind of tricks?”<br><br>“Playthings. There was a paw-paw patch and some elderberry bushes nearby where Uncle took me to gather the wood he needed. He took a length of a thumb-sized branch about six inches long and trimmed one end at an angle of about 45 degrees, then cut a notch in the bark. Next he bruised the bark and slipped it off the wood. He whittled away about half the wood over a three-inch length starting at the point of the notch. He cut out a small flat sliver in the tapered end to make an air passage to the notch in the bark, then replaced the cylinder of bark; voila a whistle.”&nbsp;<br><br>“Neat-o, Grandpa. If you lost it you could make another one.”<br><br>“Uncle showed me how to make a pop gun usin’ the elderberry wood. Elderberry wood has a pithy center. We had a stalk about an inch diameter. Uncle burned out the pith from a piece about a foot long with a red-hot poker. All we needed to complete the project was a plunger a little shorter than the hollow elderberry and we would have our popgun. Of course we needed some ammunition. I just chewed a piece of paper and rammed a wad down the tube. I inserted another wad and pushed it rapidly into the tube with the plunger. The first wad flew out with a pop, almost as loud as a cap pistol. I found that I could even hit a target close by.”<br><br>“I hope Uncle didn’t burn himself with the poker.”<br><br>“He was careful. We had a nice forked piece of wood left. It looked just right for makin’ a slingshot. We needed only a strip of rubber from an inner tube, some twine and perhaps a small piece of leather, and we’d be in business. Now days it may be hard to find an old inner tube, but it’s possible. You want to be careful using a slingshot; windows break easily and it hurts to get hit by a flyin’ pebble.”<br><br>“Did you make a sling shot?”<br><br>“ Oh Yeah. We made all those things and more. The fun of makin’ em’ was more fun than playin’ with ‘em. Besides, you learn to use your hands and a knife.”<br><br>“Gee, it sounds like a lot of fun. I’d like to try it some time.”<br><br>“I know where there’s a paw-paw patch. Let’s go check it out.”	1	2017-04-22 19:21:10.734801	2017-04-23 00:12:22.223097	2008	1	\N	\N	\N	742	\N	\N
172	Stakeout	Headline of short item on page 3 of local paper: “Slick Eludes Police Again” The item stated in part, “Police response to tips by citizens proved to be too slow…..”<br><br>Police may have considered the tips a hoax, or maybe they were on a coffee break, but it was no hoax. A warrant had been issued for the perpetrator.<br><br>For months Ms. Slick made small purchases at Kat’s Little Shop of Treasures, usually paying cash but with checks for larger purchases. Kat noticed that Slick carried a large purse that was always open. Was Slick buying a little and stealing a lot? Evidence that Slick was a shoplifter came from a fellow shop owner who got a picture of Slick dropping merchandise into the big purse. She turned over the evidence to the district attorney. Slick failed to show up for a court subpoena, resulting in a warrant for her arrest.&nbsp;<br><br>Meanwhile Slick’s checks were returned unpaid. Both Kat and Mouse, her assistant, made several phone calls to Slick asking her to come in and redeem the checks. She promised to come in, but she never showed up.<br><br>“We’re going to get Slick put in jail where she belongs,” Kat said to Mouse. “If we can get her to come in to pay off these checks we’ll have the cops pick her up here. You call her and see if you can get her to come in,”<br><br>Mouse called and said, “Can you come in and pay off the checks?”<br><br>“Will Kat be there?” said Slick.<br><br>“No,” said Mouse.<br><br>“Then I’ll come in this morning,” she said.<br><br>Mid afternoon came and no show. Kat pressed a number on her cell phone. A man answered.<br><br>“Your wife wrote us a check that bounced. It has your name on it and she signed it with your name.<br><br>“I don’t have an account at that bank,” he said.<br><br>“Well, I’m going to the DA with it in the morning,” said Kat.<br><br>“You close at six? Could you stay open a few minutes longer? It’ll take a while to get there”, he said before hanging up.<br><br>“She’s coming a six o’clock. Let’s be ready,” Kat said to Mouse. “I’ll be in back of the shop when she comes in. Keep her busy as long as you can”<br><br>Kat called the police to inform them that Ms. Slick would be coming to the shop later in the day. She reminded them of the warrant and that they could pick her up there. Kat and Mouse continued their work running the shop as usual until closing time, when Mouse exclaimed, “Here she comes!”<br><br>Kat called the police to inform them. Then she got into her car and drove around to the parking lot in front of the shop where she could watch for the police. She was still on her cell phone with the police dispatcher.<br><br>“She’s in the shop now,” she said. “we’ll keep her as long as we can.”<br><br>Inside the shop Mouse was attending Slick slowly, ringing up numbers on the cash register, rooting around for the pencil she “lost”, misplacing a stapler, dropping and picking up a piece of paper, examining each piece of currency given her, and a multitude of other things to delay the transaction. After ten minutes or so a man whom Mouse assumed to be a policeman walked toward the shop door. Slick turned toward the door and Mouse reacted by pointing toward her, hoping the “policeman” would get her signal. The man was evidently Slick’s husband, for he came in and hustled her out the door and into his car parked nearby.<br><br>“Hello, this is Kat again. The police are not here yet. Slick just came out of the shop with her husband and got into a gray Honda minivan. I can’t see the license plate.<br><br>“The car just pulled out! It’s turning right and moving down the street.&nbsp;<br><br>“I can still see the car. It’s turning in at the gas station half a block from here. I’ll drive down there where I can see the car better.<br><br>“I’m at the Pier One store. The man is filling up his tank. The man is back in his car now. A police car just pulled into the station. Now the Honda just pulled out and turned right on to the street!<br><br>“The police car is turning around to leave the station, but the gray Honda is out of sight!” Hopping mad and out of breath through excitement, Kat drove back to the shop.<br><br>“Did they arrest her? Mouse asked with great anticipation.<br><br>“(expletive deleted) NO! A cop showed up just as they were leaving. He didn’t even recognize the car as it left. The police worked at a snail’s pace. They could have had her if they’d wanted her,” Kat said. “Did you get our money back?”<br><br>“Yeah, and I gave her a receipt, but I forgot to stamp the shop name on it. She left in a hurry,” Mouse said, “I don’t think she’ll be back to get the receipt stamped.”<br><br>“Looks like we’ve lost a customer,” Kat said.	1	2017-04-22 19:21:24.67816	2017-04-23 00:12:22.229872	2008	1	\N	\N	\N	934	\N	\N
163	Brother Where Art Thou?	The task of being executor of my father’s will fell to my sister Margaret who lived in Oak Ridge, Tennessee not far from Dad’s home. She looked after him in his last years. He suffered diabetes and as it turned out so did both my brother Jim and my sister. Dad was the sole survivor of his second wife’s family. They left their estate to Dad. His will left all of his belongings to his three children.<br><br>“Have you found out where Jim is?” I asked Margaret as we were clearing the stuff out of Dad’s house.<br><br>“No, not yet,” Margaret said, “I guess we’ll just have to wait. The banks will find him.”<br><br>It had been about forty years since there had been any contact with Jim. It seemed that no one knew why he had stopped all communication with the family. I know this hurt Dad very much. I don’t know, but I suspect it had something to do with a disagreement between Dad and Jim about money.<br><br>Jim was born into the family when I was twelve years old. I don’t believe that I was as thrilled with him as was the rest of the family. I’d wanted a brother but one much nearer my own age. As he grew from a mere baby to a toddler his blond hair also grew. He grew the most beautiful curly locks ever seen around our town. Mom wouldn’t think of trimming them to make him look like a boy. Under duress, however, she relented to allow a haircut before he went off to school. A few weeks later I left home for college to see him only occasionally on my visits home<br><br>Jim came to Lima to visit me twice before his extended silence began. Soon after his first visit he, at age fifteen, married a young girl from Northern Kentucky, across the state from his home. They moved to California soon after that and started a family. They had two little girls, and when they were about two and four Jim brought his little family to visit my family. We had a very amiable time during their visit. We expected to see them again in the future. But it never happened. Dad heard from Jim’s wife, Peggy once in a while but many times she didn’t know where Jim was. His life was certainly a mystery to us for years to come.<br><br>As Margaret predicted the bankers found Jim so that he could get his share of the estate. Margaret and husband Ray visited him and his new wife, Dorothy. Jim and Dorothy later traveled east looking for a retirement home. Margaret had them and my Dorothy and me all meet at her house. It was a great reunion. Both Jim and I had wives named Dorothy Jessee. So to prevent much confusion Jim’s became Dorothy-1 and mine Dorothy-2, according to seniority as a Jessee. We had a short and friendly visit for a little more than a day, mostly in getting acquainted. We agreed to make plans to get together for a week next summer. We didn’t learn much about why Jim disappeared for so long, but maybe we would next time.<br><br>Ray decided to drive his SUV to Flagstaff, Arizona where I’d reserved a week at a resort. Dorothy-2 and I met them at their house and we traveled together with them. Jim and Dorothy-1 came from California and met us at the resort for a week of relaxation and sightseeing.<br><br>“This looks like a really nice place to hang out for a week,” everybody agreed, after a warm greeting when we had all arrived.<br><br>“Looks like we have an attic. Who wants to sleep up there?” I asked.<br><br>“’We’ll volunteer,” said Dorothy-1, and that was a settled matter.<br><br>“We’ll need to make a trip to a grocery store,” Dorothy-2 observed, and so we made preparations to stay a while.<br><br>A day or so later we had visitors from Salt Lake City. Jim’s son Mike and his wife and daughter showed up for a visit, and were in and out for about three days. I had never met Mike or his family. Mike was Jim’s youngest. At any rate they were a welcome addition to our little family.<br><br>We spent one day at the Grand Canyon. We all wandered around like tourists while Ray rode a mule down the trail into the canyon. He survived the trip without problems.<br><br>Another day we went to a place where the trail was somewhat rough and was strewn with pieces of lava. Along the trail Jim stumbled and fell, skinning his leg. His feet were numb because of his diabetes and he hadn’t noticed the rough spot under his foot. Dorothy-1 was worried about the skinned spot on his leg. The rest of that day was spent tending his wound, which wasn’t as serious as Dorothy-1 had feared. The week passed as if we were a normal family. We were all in favor of doing it again.<br><br>Jim and Dorothy-1 found their retirement place and moved to Fredericksburg, Texas. Unfortunately I never saw Jim again. Their retirement didn’t last long. They had just got settled in well when, as many diabetics, Jim died of a massive heart attack.<br><br>I’m truly sorry that my reacquaintance with our brother was so short-lived but I’m forever grateful to Margaret and the bankers for finding him.	1	2017-04-22 19:00:34.421464	2017-04-23 00:12:22.236578	2013	1	\N	\N	Non-Fiction	958	\N	\N
166	Blind Move	She was supposed to look after me in my old age, but she didn’t stick with me until I got really old. Dorothy, like my first wife, Mary, died of cancer. Now here I was in 2003 alone again and worse, going blind a little every day with ARMD (age related macular degeneration). I’d considered looking into an assisted living place, but without outside help I’d be stuck there without even groceries. All my children offered to take me in, but only Catherine seemed to really want me to live with her.<br><br>“Come on down for a trial run. If you like it you can move in,” Catherine said.<br><br>“Sounds good to me,” I said.<br><br>“You won’t have to cook your own meals.”<br><br>“Even better, let’s go.” I said, and we went. I spent most of the summer of ’04 on my trial run in my private quarters, and I decided to become a resident of Lafayette.<br><br>Back in Lima, Ohio I began to prepare for my move by putting my house up for sale, but first there were a few things to be done to enhance the appeal to a buyer, like installing new carpet, fixing the broken floor in the garage and things of that nature.<br><br>Once the renovations were complete some of my children came back to help me get ready for the move. The house was full of a sixty-year collection of stuff. It wasn’t all junk, as might be expected, but nothing was sixty years old. Some of it was pretty good stuff, but little of it could I take with me.<br><br>My son David is a take-charge kind of a guy, and before I knew what was happening he had assessed the job at hand and put an ad in the Lima News with the head line MOVING SALE under which were listed a dozen or so household items, such as furniture etc,. When I saw the ad, dread hit me in the gut. We were to be inundated by a swarm of people, all looking for no-cost bargains. They were right to think that way; if they’re moving they’ll sell for practically nothing. They were right; the horde came and left with most everything except the advertised items that asked a fair price. I think the children took what was offered to get rid of the mob. We sold or gave away much of the stuff I had and called Good Will to dispose of more.<br><br>During the house emptying process a deputy sheriff stopped by the house. “Are you Mr. Jessee?” he said.<br><br>“Yes, I am,” I said.<br><br>“Is this your mail?” He said showing me an envelope with my name and address on it.<br><br>“The builder wants you to stop dumping your trash in his dumpster. He won’t press charges if you remove the stuff you put in it.”<br><br>“OK, I’ll see that it gets cleared out,” I assured him. Houses were being built across the road and David took the opportunity to get rid of some trash, but why did he pick trash with my name engraved on it? David was later seen with a sack in hand heading toward the construction area. We considered our position and got our own dumpster where we disposed of worthless things.<br><br>We cleared out the house except for a few pieces of furniture. Our real estate broker was very helpful in selling the pieces we left behind.<br><br>Within a couple of days of my arrival at Catherine’s home it had become my home too. She showed me around town and introduced me to some of her friends. I hadn’t been with her very long until she had figured out things I needed to do to keep myself busy. She found out about a life writing class, and before I knew what happened I was enrolled in Kim’s class. Mostly I have enjoyed it. I’d even recommend it, but beware, the first term cost me only $20.	1	2017-04-22 19:19:26.516185	2017-04-23 00:12:22.24983	2012	1	\N	\N	Non-Fiction	705	\N	\N
162	About Being an Insider	I was an insider for about forty weeks but that was a long time ago, and I’d have to stretch my brain to find myself an insider since I was born. Wait, maybe I was an insider when I was a Boy Scout leader. A watermelon seed is an insider, I guess, but it must give up its status to achieve its purpose. Oh phooey, I give up. Where’s the dictionary?<br><br>Insider: a person recognized or accepted as a member of a group, category, or organization as a person who is in position of power or has access to confidential information.<br><br>The next question is whether I or somebody else is the insider to be discussed. Who has more influence on society than anyone else? The answer must be those who teach future generations. Could that be parents? I recall each of my children at some time coming home from school and reporting a brilliant new idea learned from the teacher. The truth is that the same idea had been discussed at home for several months. So much for eating supper together, but thankfully all of parents’ words didn’t fall on deaf ears.<br><br>It must be that teachers are the insiders I want to discuss. Do teachers fit the definition of insider? Teachers are accepted as members of a category of persons in position of power. They are in a position of power to shape the minds of children.<br><br>I believe that teachers have a greater influence on children than do parents in the long run. Teachers have many if not most students for twelve years and some for four more years of college. They learn many things that will affect society. Consider the ridiculous notion of man-made global warming, same-sex marriage and a host of moral changes in the wind. Such ideas are taught by only a few teachers. It doesn’t take many to propagate ideas to young minds.<br><br>I believe that all teachers are insiders. The great majority is prohibited from teaching moral values as they once did and so they apparently remain quiet rather than teach moral values for fear of showing Christian religious bias. Even the insiders have restrictions.	1	2017-04-22 19:00:15.318504	2017-07-29 00:35:04.088456	2013	9	teacher.png	\N	Non-Fiction	377	Late	Story
129	Advice	On occasions I have noticed things that I thought could be done a better way, perhaps improved with a slight change, maybe to simplify it. I never considered that advice, but maybe it was. In a previous writing I did give what I considered real advice, and I still think it’s good advice. It was directed to my children.<br><br>There was a time in our lives when all my children managed with some difficulty to get together at least once a year. Sometimes it was at a campground and sometimes at a resort. My late wife Dorothy made it possible through her planning and persistence. She loved my offspring as if they were her own flesh and blood. She saw the benefit of such gatherings and kept at the job until it happened. Seldom did all of the family get together, but the loss belonged to the absentees. The rest of the gang was well served. We had great times together and all went home refreshed. We remembered a walk in the woods to see a waterfall, the meeting of a bear on the trail, the sights in a resort area, games and conversation around the supper table. They were all fond memories.<br><br>Today it is easy to grab the cell phone and speak to a sibling or tune in to a “face book” or send an email with pictures or not. These are mighty convenient and easy things, but there is nothing that can take the place of eye-to-eye contact or the touch of a hand.<br><br>Our last two family reunions were bittersweet affairs, both brought about by death in the family, first my sister Margaret, then a month later, my daughter Susanna. Attendance at both funerals was excellent, and I might add with little planning ahead. Despite the reason for the gatherings to say sad goodbyes and to celebrate the lives of loved ones, there was joy in the reunions, of simply being together.<br><br>I gave my best advice to my children a few years ago to continue their annual reunions, that electronic communication is not enough. I realize that in Dorothy’s absence it will be more difficult than it was with her help but it can happen.<br><br>To make it happen it must be high on the priorities list. All must participate. I suggest that before the end of a reunion, plans however tentative be made for the next year. Of course each should take turns at being in charge.<br><br>I believe the advice I gave my children a few years ago was good sound advice and I would give it again. In fact I still hope they act on it.	1	2017-04-22 18:19:54.609129	2017-05-01 22:10:43.540778	2011	8	reunion.jpg	\N	Non-Fiction	458	Late	Letter
46	Award	A summons came to report to the corner office. The corner office was that of the Division Manager at Westinghouse Aviation Division. In addition to Dan Yorksie, Engineering Manager, Don Baker, Mark Rosswurm and I were among the guests. The gathering turned out to be an awards ceremony, during which Yorksie presented an Engineering Achievement Award to Baker, Rosswurm and Jessee. Yorksie said that the Awards Program had been established to offer a new dimension of recognition of deserving individuals throughout the Corporation. In his introduction of the three recipients he briefly described the nature of the achievements leading to each of the awards.<br><br>“Don’s important invention corrected irregularities in circuit performance, giving us better output, which meant less filtering, less cost and less weight,” Yorksie said of my contribution, “and in our industry, anything that saves weight is fantastic.<br><br>“His circuit, which is patented, protects our lead in the marketplace and gives us a competitive advantage. That certainly deserves special mention and a special award.”<br><br>He was talking about a system that he had early on in its development dubbed the “Jessee Circuit” for controlling the operation of an electric power converter that converted direct current to alternating current for use in airplanes. In its basic form the converter output voltage was subject to distortion by load changes and by variations in switching devices. My job had been to take into account these corrupting variations and eliminate their influence. The ”Jessee Circuit” did the job. I’ve always wondered if Yorksie named it after me so that he would remember whom to blame in case it didn’t work. Hmm. Nevertheless I heartily agree with the choices for the Engineering Achievement Awards. We deserved them.<br><br>During my career I received an award for submitting the most meritorious patent disclosure of the year at least four times. Along with others I received a George Westinghouse Signature Award of Excellence. Of all the awards received I regard the Engineering Achievement Award the most significant.<br><br>FOOTNOTE: Copies of newspaper clippings and an award certificate are included as part of this report.	1	2017-04-21 22:28:43.379222	2017-06-04 20:12:18.698592	2007	5	westinghouseaward.jpg	\N	\N	360	\N	\N
106	Barbershop Chatter	“Good morning young man.”&nbsp;<br><br>“Howdy.”&nbsp;<br><br>“Come in and have a seat, we’ll get to you pretty soon. Where’s your pretty young woman this morning?”<br><br>“Sent her to buy groceries. A feller has to eat.”<br><br>“Dat’s right, one of d’ reasons we work so hard here.”<br><br>All quiet for a few seconds, then from across the room, “Say Matt, did Chet find a job yet?”<br><br>“Don’t believe he did. He’s been outa work over six months. He may get a little part time work. His wife’s got a job but I don’t tink she makes much.”<br><br>“Next.”<br><br>“I’m waiting for Jeff.”<br><br>“We had a lot of trick-or-treaters last night. Did you?”<br><br>“Quite a few. Dere were some cute kids. Tree teenagers came by. I got over dat by da time I was ten. Anyhow one of ‘em had on an Obama mast. Da wife gave the other two treats but Obama got nothing. When he protested she told him she was just spreadin da wealth.”<br><br>Just then a guy walked in. “What do you charge for a haircut? I been goin to a place where women cut hair and I’m looking for a better haircut.”<br><br>“Fourteen dollars.” The guy turned and left.<br><br>“Next. How’ve you been, Ben? Haven’t seen you for a while.”<br><br>“OK. I’ve been out of town for a few weeks, visiting my mother. She needed some help.”<br><br>“How do you want it cut, the usual?”<br><br>“Bye now. Come back when we can be of service.”<br><br>“How does it look to you?”<br><br>“Uh – good, but can you take a little more off the top?”<br><br>“Bob’s barber shop. No we’re not too busy. Only one ahead of you right now.”<br><br>“Been fishing lately Bill?”<br><br>“Yeah. Last week. They were biting pretty good. Going to take my grandson out this weekend. Teach him some of the finer points of the game.”<br><br>“Come in my friend, out of the rain.”<br><br>“Hi. Can a guy get a haircut here?”<br><br>“Sure can. Have a seat. Looks like there’s just one ahead of you.”<br><br>“And my wife said she’s going to the beauty parlor, so I thought it a good time to come and get a haircut, so here I am.”<br><br>“Did I hear it right? Obama is going to India on another vacation on taxpayer’s money at two hundred million a day?”<br><br>“ Yeah. Taking forty airplanes and three thousand people. The country’s already broke.”<br><br>“I hope that the Indians keep him and all his freeloaders.”<br><br>“There you are. All the ladies will be swooning over you.

125	About Food	An item in the news a few days ago informed us that a bunch of people such a PETA, or some similar outfit, had demanded that a mayor of a small town change its name. As if it were any of their business, they went so far as to suggest a new name for the town. The town under verbal siege was Turkey, Texas. I can’t be sure what the specific objection was but judging from the suggested new name, and the fact that the news came just before Thanksgiving Day, that it had something to do with eating turkeys. The new name they suggested was (hold your hat) Tofurkey. So far as I have heard the mayor has not made any attempt to change the name of his town. Congratulations to the mayor.<br><br>It seems to me that there are way too many people in the world who think there is nothing better too do than to make themselves busy-bodies. They know more and how better to do things than anybody else. Do they also run the government? Even if they really were “holier than thou”, it’s none of their business what name a Texas town has or whether they eat turkey or tofu.<br><br>No one can argue that killing for food is unnatural. The whole cycle of life is based on it. Suppose, for example, that all carnivores were removed from the earth. What would happen to the bunny population? Owing to the habits of rabbits there would be a population explosion among them and many other grazers. Soon the expanding population of grazers would overwhelm the replacement rate of grazing material and the whole system would die off. So keep the meat eaters around.<br><br>Every living thing is food for some other living things. The strong predators are at the top of the food chain, but being at the top does not exempt them from becoming food. They die and the buzzards and other scavengers have a feast. Whatever is left after their feast, is consumed by insects or fungus. Of course plants are food for the rest of living things, and fungus gets its share of dead plants. Oh yes, bacteria are down there close to the bottom of the food chain. No living thing goes to waste.&nbsp;<br><br>I should mention that humankind manages to have first dibs on food, but remember that there are worms and germs in the ground that like to eat.<br><br>I urge the people of Turkey, Texas and everywhere else to ignore busy-bodies, keep your town name, and eat what you want that you can afford.	1	2017-04-22 18:17:32.754814	2017-05-01 22:03:52.488879	2011	9	turkey.jpg	\N	Non-Fiction	448	Late	Story
