                                <p class="nexa-light">Ralph Donald was born to I.W. “Ike” and Ivo Jessee on September 13, 1921, in Appalachia, Virginia. His grandparents were subsistence farmers, his father was a clerk with the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, and his mother was a schoolteacher. In the third grade his family moved with the Railroad to Pineville, Kentucky, where he played football with, and graduated from, Pineville High School. He attended Lincoln Memorial University, in Harrogate, Tennessee, for two years and then transferred to the University of Kentucky in Lexington. He graduated in 1943 with a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering.</p>

                                <p class="nexa-light">Setting aside a job offer from the Manhattan Project because the recruiters wouldn’t tell him what he would be doing, he accepted a position from Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which took him to the Aero Space Division in Lima, Ohio. However, he was soon drafted into the U.S. Army Signal Corps. Shortly after boot camp he had surgery on his thyroid, was honorably discharged, and returned to his job in Lima. Young Engineer Jessee thrived in his work environment. He enjoyed the camaraderie and the technical challenges and quickly became a top engineer in the critical work of building innovative and reliable electrical systems for the nation’s military aircraft.</p>

                            <p class="nexa-light">Although he led innovation on a wide variety of projects, one core and persistent foci of his career was improving systems that used converters to make alternating electric current (AC) from direct current (DC) sources by switching the output terminal to the source in a unique way. His job was to develop elegant control schemes to prevent the degradation of the output quality. A tale he wrote after he retired describes the help he received from a master. After several days of trying to understand why a model of one of his elegant control scheme designs was not working as planned, he arrived home with the intention of relaxing and putting the problem out of mind. He sat back and listened to a sublime piano concerto by Mozart and was carried away. When he came back to earth, he found himself at work on the problem, but the tension was gone. He knew what caused the anomaly and modified the design.</p>

                            <p class="nexa-light">During his career, Ralph Donald’s work garnered thirty patents. At least four times he received an award for submitting the most meritorious patent disclosure of the year. Along with colleagues he received the George Westinghouse Signature Award of Excellence. Of all the awards received, he regarded the Engineering Achievement Award the most significant. That award recognized the importance and ingenuity of his invention of a system still call the “Jessee Circuit” that controls the operation of an electric power converter that converted direct current to alternating current for use in airplanes. In its basic form the converter output voltage was subject to distortion by load changes and by variations in switching devices. Ralph Donald’s task was to take into account these corrupting variations and eliminate their influence. The ”Jessee Circuit” did the job. He loved his work, and his very productive career with Westinghouse and its successor firms lasted fifty-three years.</p>

                            <p class="nexa-light">A young local lass, a clerk, caught the eye of Ralph Donald after he reported for work in Lima. He married her, Mary Elizabeth Werff, in 1947, initially found very modest housing (which they referred to as a shack) , and soon started a family that quickly grew to four offspring: David Lawrence, Stephen Ross, Catherine Ann, and Susanna Marie. He provided well for, and guided well, his family, supporting their involvement in good schools, Market Street Presbyterian Church, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, the wider family, adventurous annual camping vacations, and eventually the colleges of their choice. He and Mary formed a strong team of wonderful parents, he with stern advice and wise counsel and she with a good ear, good advice, and compassion. That loving partnership came to an untimely end when Mary died of cancer in 1973. Ralph Donald stayed actively and lovingly involved with his children and his grandchildren, but the support of Mary was sorely missed.</p>

They tied a knot that came untied ten years later. A few years later he found himself in an improbable match with Dorothy Phillips, at the time 60 years old, which turned into a delightful marriage. Dorothy, never having been married, was quick to adopt Ralph Donald’s brood and they in turn were happy to welcome her into the family. She became the de facto communications and reunions director for the family, a role that was much appreciated. Ralph Donald was heartbroken when he lost her to cancer in 2005.</p>
