For instance here is one taken in the front or side yard of an old house. I see shades of gray in broad outline except for things that are familiar such as faces and certain shapes. I depend on the vision of others to identify for me other shapes. Thatâ€™s how I determined that the picture was taken in the yard of an old house."
