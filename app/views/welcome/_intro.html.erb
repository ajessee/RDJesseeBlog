            <p class="droid-serif">Ralph 'Don' Jessee (September 13th, 1921 - April 3rd, 2016) was born in the mountains of southwestern Virginia. During the Great Depression his family moved to Kentucky. After two years at Lincoln Memorial University, he earned his engineering degree at University of Kentucky. He was hired by Westinghouse and after a stint in the army he returned to the aviation division at Lima, Ohio. He enjoyed his work designing control and protective devices and methods for aircraft electric power systems. He was granted 27 U.S. patents during his 49 year career. Meanwhile he took a wife and reared a family of four children. He eventually moved to Louisiana and enrolled in the writing class at the insistence of his daughter. What followed was a prodigious output of writing. Don kept writing almost until the end and left a suprising legacy of stories, poems and letters that we have archived here for your perusal and enjoyment.
